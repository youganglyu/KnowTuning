Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 14 in the 2022 Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue; it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of 2022. It is considered as one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, and Meta (formerly Facebook).\n\nMicrosoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016, followed by their acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.\n\nAs of 2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android. The company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN), mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software development (Visual Studio).",

Since 2015, it has been known as The Emirates FA Cup after its headline sponsor. A concurrent Women's FA Cup has been held since 1970.\n\nThe competition is open to all eligible clubs down to Level 9 of the English football league system with Level 10 clubs acting as stand-ins in the event of non-entries from above. Included in the competition are 20 professional clubs in the Premier League (level 1), 72 professional clubs in the English Football League (levels 2 to 4), and all clubs in steps 1\u20135 of the National League System (levels 5 to 9) as well as a tiny number of step 6 clubs acting as stand-ins for non-entries above. A record 763 clubs competed in 2011\u201312. The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final. Entrants are not seeded, although a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds \u2013 the minimum number of games needed to win, depending on which round a team enters the competition, ranges from six to fourteen.\n\nThe first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, from which 32 teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from Leagues One and Two. The last entrants are the Premier League and Championship clubs, into the draw for the Third Round Proper. In the modern era, only one non-League team has ever reached the quarter-finals, and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final. As a result, significant focus is given to the smaller teams who progress furthest, especially if they achieve an unlikely \"giant-killing\" victory.\n\nWinners receive the FA Cup trophy, of which there have been two designs and five actual cups; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design, introduced in 1911. Winners also qualify for the UEFA Europa League and a place in the upcoming FA Community Shield. Arsenal are the most successful club with fourteen titles and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is the most successful manager in the history of the competition, having won seven finals as Arsenal's manager.\n\nLiverpool are the current holders, having beaten Chelsea 6\u20135 on penalties following a 0\u20130 draw in the 2022 final."

        "output": "Glass has become so commonplace today that it\u2019s easy to see right through it without a second thought. It\u2019s in our windows, on our screens, in our cabinets, and in many of the devices we interact with every day. Even though glass can be found everywhere, you may live your whole life not knowing much about how it\u2019s made or what it\u2019s composed of. Even if you think you know the basics, you\u2019ve only skimmed the surface.   \n\nAt a high level, glass is sand that\u2019s been melted down and chemically transformed. If you\u2019ve ever been to the beach, you know exactly how hot sand can get while remaining in its solid form. The kind of heat necessary to transform sand into a liquid state (eventually becoming glass) is much hotter than any sunny day. To make sand melt, you need to heat it to roughly 1700\u00b0C (3090\u00b0F), which is approximately the same temperature a space shuttle reaches as it re-enters earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThe sand commonly used to make glass is comprised of small grains of quartz crystals, made up of molecules of silicon dioxide, which is also known as silica. When those molecules are heated to high enough temperatures, the sand melts and loses its crystalline structure, and as it cools it gains an entirely different structure. That structure, on a molecular level, is somewhere in between a liquid and a solid. This in-between state is known as an amorphous solid, which means it has some of the crystalline structure of a solid coupled with the molecular randomness of a liquid.\n\nGlass Melting\nDepending on the sand mixture, glass can have a variety of properties. Certain elements or chemicals mixed with sand can change glass\u2019s color, for example. Glass\u2019s properties can also change based on how it\u2019s manufactured and the processes by which it\u2019s shaped afterward. To strengthen glass, manufacturers can use thermal tempering to heat and cool it rapidly. Glass can also be strengthened chemically through an ion exchange process that makes the surface of the glass tougher.\n\nThe glass most people are familiar with is soda-lime glass, which is a combination of soda (also known as soda ash or washing soda), limestone, and sand. Although you can make glass simply by heating and then rapidly cooling silica, the manufacturing of soda-lime glass is a little more complex. By adding soda (sodium carbonate), the melting point of the sand is reduced so it can be transformed into glass at lower temperatures and save energy during manufacturing. However, adding soda to the mixture reduces its chemical durability, making it prone to dissolve when in contact with liquids. For most applications, that\u2019s not desirable, so limestone (calcium carbonate) is also added to the mixture, which acts as a stabilizer. Once the mixture of silica, soda, and limestone is heated, it can be cooled and molded for a variety of applications. \nAt Corning, we know glass. We know how to strengthen it through chemical processes like ion exchange, and we know how to bend it to make optical fiber that can stretch over vast distances. Our knowledge of glass goes back more than a century, allowing us to remain on the cutting edge of research and development. From simple soda-lime to complex glass structures that enable augmented reality, glass is an adaptable, wide-ranging material. That\u2019s why, after more than 165 years, we\u2019re still making new discoveries."

Depending on your answer you should pick a starter programming language. Popular starting programming languages include: \n    * Java (useful if you're interested in mobile apps)\n    * Python (excellent for data analysis and a good general purpose language)\n    * JavaScript (great for website building)\n3. Find an online starter tutorial for your language of choice. A quick internet search should come up with a few. A good alternative are so-called MOOCs (massive open online course). Some examples of this are Georgia Tech, CalTech, CodeAcademy's courses, Coursera and many others.\n4. Once completed, consider your goal from step 1. Search for a course that focuses on the practical applications which interest you the most.\n5. Look for books or online sources for your application of choice. O'Reilly Publishing has a great set of books on all matter of technical subjects.\n6. Once you've completed the basics - try out a side project.\n7. After this you should have a good grasp on the basics in your area of choice. Consider exploring and going broader or looking into more advanced topics."

If plaque and calculus remain on teeth it can increase the risk of gum disease and cavities.  Maintaining a healthy mouth is important for oral health as well as systemic health, e.g. Cardiovascular Health.    Dentists recommend to brush your teeth twice a day for 2 minutes each time and flossing at least once a day.  When brushing it is best to wait 30 minutes after drinking acidic beverages, such as coffee or citrus juice.

White light enters, and a rainbow of colors exits. Our sun is like that. Its light may seem uniform but it is actually emitting many different colors.\n\nOur sky though is not a mix of blue and red and green because the earth's atmosphere is sandwiched between the sun and us, getting in the way. Atmospheric gases and particles scatter the incoming colors, bouncing them in all different directions.  The amount of scattering increases as the wavelength of light decreases.  Red light which has a long wavelength is scattered much less than blue light which has a short wavelength. As blue is scattered more, it fills our daytime sky.\n\nAs the sun traverses the sky and moves low on the horizon, the light that reaches our eyes must actually travel further through the atmosphere.  This has the effect of completely bouncing away all the blue light.  We are left with the reds and yellows and oranges in wonderful mixture, making sunrises and sunsets so beautiful."

For adults, this is complicated by the fact that every adult individual has the right to refuse medical care.  A person suffering from a severe mental illness will often refuse care due to their delusions and paranoia.  Frequently, concerned family members must wait until the relative has a serious psychotic episode at which time they can contact emergency services and have the individual evaluated as a threat to themselves or others. At this point, it might be possible for the government to compel the individual to be diagnosed and receive mental health treatment."

Even timid cats can be tempted if you figure out what foods they really like.  Start with a smelly food like tuna fish or tinned chicken, or raw meat cat treats if you have them.  Don't expect the cat to approach you immediately.  Put the treat on the ground and sit nearby.  Be careful not to stare at the cat since that is an aggressive gesture.  If the cat takes the treat, try throwing or laying out another treat, this time a bit closer to you.  Repeat until the cat is nearby.  It will learn to associate you with happiness (food)."

Add an underlayment on top of the decking. This is a synthetic barrier that guards against water and fire, and helps the roof maintain its shape if the wood under it expands or contracts.\n4. Add flashing around vertical elements on the roof. Flashing is a thin sheet of metal that prevents water from getting into gaps around vertical elements like chimneys and vents.\n5. Apply shingles to the roof. Shingles are made of asphalt and they are the outermost layer of a roof. Shingles are the first line of defense in protecting your home, but they can also add color and design elements to your home."

These can be actively managed, where a company or advisor controls the underlying investments in these funds, or passively managed, where the fund tracks a specific market or list of companies (example: XLF, a fund that tracks the broader banking industry). \n\nIn terms of managing risk, generally you have a higher percentage of stocks vs. bonds or cash in your portfolio earlier in your career, with this mix shifting toward lower risk bonds as you get closer to retirement. Generally speaking, while actively managed funds do in some instances perform well, they are, on average, very similar in their performance to passively managed index funds and, due to their associated fees, most experts agree it's wise to focus on broad market index funds. \n\nA common retirement portfolio for a 30 year old might be comprised 50-75% of large capitalization domestic stock funds. It's typically wise to have some exposure to foreign markets and small/medium capitalization domestic stocks or specific market segments, with minimal bonds or cash until later in life."

The signals are the sensations or emotions or sounds that one is feeling and hearing in the present moment.  To accomplish this, the breath serves as an anchor to the present moment.  Being aware of one's breath keeps us in the present moment.  When the mind eventually wanders, the breath is a signal to tune back into the present moment.

GDP is most often used by the government of a single country to measure its economic health. Due to its complex and subjective nature, this measure is often revised before being considered a reliable indicator. GDP (nominal) per capita does not, however, reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore, using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) may be more useful when comparing living standards between nations, while nominal GDP is more useful comparing national economies on the international market. Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy. The ratio of GDP to the total population of the region is the per capita GDP (also called the Mean Standard of Living)."

Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow.\" In Churchill's mind, the \"iron curtain\" defines the boundary which separates western European countries under US influence and eastern European countries under Soviet Control. This was further solidified by the creation of the Berlin wall and the Soviet supported Communist governments that ruled over eastern European countries throughout the cold war. After the collapse of Soviet Union, the iron curtain disappeared as many eastern European countries topped their Communist governments and joined the Western sphere of influence."

Influencers usually have a defined niche, and can make up to six figures or more creating content about it. However, at least in the beginning, your income will likely not come in a steady manner, and you may even be investing more into getting set up than you may be earning in return. The work happens in a freelance manner - if you like setting your own schedule this could appeal to you, but the flip side would be that your work bleeds more into your weekends and evenings. Some people also would love the idea of pursuing their hobbies and interest full time, but when they have to treat it as their job, soon become disenchanted. \n\nIn summary, your decision to become an influencer should be based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and personal working style and interests."

Just before President Adams left office he appointed new justices of the peace for Washington D.C., Jefferson, the next President refused to deliver the commissions.  This led to the case Marbury vs Madison.  The basis of the case was that the Judiciary Act of 1789 allowed for the appointed to request a court order to grant their appointments with original jurisdiction given to the Supreme Court. John Marshall saw that siding with Jefferson would make it seem like the Supreme Court was his lackey.  If they sided with Adams, there was no way to make Jefferson enforce the ruling.  Both decisions would reduce the Supreme Court's legitimacy. John Marshall side-stepped this problem by striking down the Judiciary Act on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. This was the establishment of judicial review, a Supreme Court power that was only hinted at in the Constitution."

Rather, it is a process of reducing the need for food. Fasting provides the digestive and assimilation process a break so that the rest of the body begins to excrete on the cellular level. This helps to remove all the toxic impurities that had accumulated in the cells over a long period of time. Hence intermittent fasting is extremely beneficial to the body."

        "input": "",
        "output": "A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. At small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern \"classical\" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is still largely experimental and impractical.\n\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing is the qubit, similar to the bit in traditional digital electronics. Unlike a classical bit, a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two \"basis\" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently.\n\nPhysically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research that aims to develop scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Two of the most promising technologies are superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).\n\nAny computational problem that can be solved by a classical computer can also be solved by a quantum computer. Conversely, any problem that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer, at least in principle given enough time. In other words, quantum computers obey the Church\u2013Turing thesis. This means that while quantum computers provide no additional advantages over classical computers in terms of computability, quantum algorithms for certain problems have significantly lower time complexities than corresponding known classical algorithms. Notably, quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain problems quickly that no classical computer could solve in any feasible amount of time\u2014a feat known as \"quantum supremacy.\" The study of the computational complexity of problems with respect to quantum computers is known as quantum complexity theory."

Preparation ensures that the appropriate texture has been introduced to the top layer of the concrete and helps the epoxy to bond with the concrete better. This ensures long-lasting results. All of these different methods of preparing concrete vary in terms of the level of difficulty as well as the efficacy produced. Following are the most popular techniques:\n\n1. Acid Etching: This is the most DIY friendly option & involves the use of an acid that is allowed to rest for some time over the concrete surface and then cleaned after a few minutes. This is also the quickest among all the techniques. The downside however is that the etching process may not produce the best concrete texture that ensures a long-lasting bond. \n2. Walk-behind Concrete Diamond grinder: This produces one of the best results when compared to the other techniques. It involves the use of a walk behind concrete grinder which has been fitted with a diamond grinding attachment. The disadvantage of this method is that it requires specialized equipment which may not be readily available & is a lot more time consuming compared to Acid etching.\n3. Hand Grinder with Diamond Cup Wheel: This is the most accessible option that yields results that are equivalent to using a walk-behind concrete grinder. The only drawback of this approach is that this is the most time consuming compared to other methods and is only practical for covering small areas."

In documenting this algorithm, Lovelace has been recognised as the world's first computer programmer, and in the notes that accompanied it she is also credited with making the first distinction between hardware and software. \n\nAlan Turing is often recognised as being the father of modern computer science, and for developing the first modern computers. During the Second World War, Turing's devices broke the Enigma Code, which was used by the Germans to encode all of their military communications. In so doing, Turing is credited with saving millions of lives. After the war, Turing published a detailed design for an \"Automatic Computing Engine\" (ACE), which very much a precursor of the modern computer, even storing its programs in memory. \n\nIn 1950, Turing published a paper describing what become known as the \"Turing Test\" - a method to compare human and machine outputs.

Therefore, daylight savings was originally instituted to facilitate a farmer's workday so that much of the working hours could coincide with the hours where there was more daylight (daylight begins is later in the spring). Since then; however, the U.S. economy has become less agriculturally based and also with technological advancements that have drastically impacted American work patterns, the need to follow daylight windows has reduced dramatically. While daylight savings still allows many Americans to spend their working hours during the daylight, there is the popular opinion that daylight savings should no longer be observed in the United States, especially with the confusion that comes with changing hours during the spring and fall.  There are at least a couple states that do not change times for daylight savings which further adds to the confusion."

        "output": "Music is often broken down into fundamental components using this model of understanding: Melody, Harmony, and Rhythm.  Of these three it is true rhythm is the easiest for computers to do a near perfect job of imitating.  Advancements in technology from the first drum machines that appeared in the 1970s, to widely used beat machines of the 1990's, to software music composition suites of today means you now have a lot of control at youf finger tips to create rhythm. You can now create drum beats that account for tempo variations, pitch variations, changes in dynamics, how close the drum pattern stays on beat, the type of hit the beat should be using, what the tension on the drum heads should sound like, how much rebound against the drum head is present, velocity of the stick, the simulated room size of where the drum kit is located,  how much resonance is vibrating in the drum kit itself, tonal variance of the wood shells used to create the drum beat and many more.   These advancements make software drumbeats realistic, and indistinguishable from their human counterparts yet the role of the drummer in modern music could not be more important.  Humans love live music, and very few commercially successful live musical acts do not use a live drummer.  Even rap and hip hop--two musical genres famous for ushering in the area of \"sampled\" drum beats, and \"sampled song loops\"-- often will have a live drummer on stage despite the ease of which the music can be broadcast loudly without requiring one.   The reason is simple: live drums and the musicians who perform using them are both visually and sonically exciting.  There are genres where a drummer is not provided such as \"DJ Couture\" and \"Electronic Dance music\" (or EDM) but they are the exceptions and not the rule. From the earliest humans banging rocks and sticks together, to the modern drums of today the future of the live drummer in music has never been brighter."

On the other hand, frozen vegetables are harvested close to peak maturity and nutrition levels.\n\nUnless you have your own kitchen garden or have access to a farmers market located close to where the vegetables are actually grown, frozen is a better bet - it's fresher, more convenient and rather crucially, more easily accessible for you to improve the health quotient of your meals. It's better to eat frozen peas all through the year than be puritanical about enjoying it only during winter. Eating healthily is as much a behavior science problem as it is a nutrition science problem, and it's easier to keep frozen peas around and eat it regularly than to try and remember what is currently in season and go out of the way to procure them fresh all the time.

Although many definitions of woke exist, these definitions run along a few common threads. Woke is typically used to describe the ideals underpinning what is known as equality of outcome. This is to be contrasted with the opposing political forces who support equality of opportunity.\n\nThose who engage in wokeness more often than not cite disparities as evidence of systemic biases or expressions of racism, sexism, classism, genderism, agism and other prejudices. A common example would be that females are disproportionately represented in elementary school teaching whereas males are disproportionately represented in railroad construction. Woke politics would lead us to believe that this is evidence of sexism: women and men are socialized differently so they are pushed into different positions by institutions. Woke opponents would lead us to believe this is evidence of inate preferences different between the sexes: males are generally stronger than females, so men are more suited to performing heavy labor.\n\nWokeness is controversial because its opponents do not believe disparity is evidence of bias. Disparities can exist due to natural or cultural differences, neither of which can be governed out of existence. The opponents of woke ideology also proclaim that it ignores the root cause of problems which plague society. If one's analysis stops at disparity and from disparity an answer is assumed, one can miss the nuances present in a situation. A common unavoidable disparity cited is that 100% of births are to females, but this is not sexism. Analysis past disparity is required to prove or disprove systemic or individual bias."

        "output": "Single-cell sequencing examines the sequence information from individual cells with optimized next-generation sequencing technologies, providing a higher resolution of cellular differences and a better understanding of the function of an individual cell in the context of its microenvironment. For example, in cancer, sequencing the DNA of individual cells can give information about mutations carried by small populations of cells. In development, sequencing the RNAs expressed by individual cells can give insight into the existence and behavior of different cell types. In microbial systems, a population of the same species can appear genetically clonal. Still, single-cell sequencing of RNA or epigenetic modifications can reveal cell-to-cell variability that may help populations rapidly adapt to survive in changing environments."

The water will need to stay on once it is started, without interruption, until your pool is full. Your pool will be considered completely full once the water reaches halfway up the tile line (middle of your waterline tile).\n\nClean up & inspection - During this phase, remove any trash that was created during the construction of your pool, and also complete the final grade of your yard. In most communities, an inspector from your city will inspect your pool area to ensure it is safe to use and everything has been properly completed.\n\nPool School - When the pool is balanced a Service Department will contact you to schedule an orientation.

Most of these children are born to parents who migrated to the USA to work in fields such as Information Technology, Research or white collar jobs that require a good academic qualification. In general, for people to migrate from India to the US one of the main criteria is exceptional academic performance with post graduate university qualifications in addition to being very proficient in English.So, the parents of these children of Indian origin have a strong academic educational background and try to create an environment at home that places great emphasis on academic learning.\n\nSpellBee has become very popular with the events being telecast on TV. The event is becoming more popular among the Indian community in the US as they see Indian kids being successful in the contests and getting national recognition when they perform well in SpellBee. When the Indian parents find that their kids are showing some aptitude in spelling and are capable of putting in the required effort, the parents start motivating the children to start practising for SpellBee contests. \n\nThese children of Indian origin spend significant effort over a period of several months or in some cases even years fine tuning their skills to practise for SpellBee contests. A combination of hard work, the support from the parents and family and the motivation of these children to perform well in SpellBee are all factors contributing to the success of the children of Indian origin in the SpellBee contests in the USA."

        "output": "There are a number of variables that can help you improve your sleep.  It is important to try different recommendations and see which ones will have the biggest impact for you.  Sleep is the foundation of our mental and physical health and performance in all endeavors. \n\n1) View sunlight by going outside within 30-60 minutes of waking. Do that again in the late afternoon, prior to sunset. If you wake up before the sun is out and you want to be awake, turn on artificial lights and then go outside once the sun rises.\nOn bright cloudless days: view morning and afternoon sun for 10 min; cloudy days: 20 min; very overcast days 30-60 min. If you live someplace with very minimal light, consider an artificial daytime simulator source.\nDon\u2019t wear sunglasses for this practice if you safely can, but contact lenses and eyeglasses are fine.\nNo, you don\u2019t have to look directly at the sun, and never look at ANY light so bright it is painful to view! That said, you can\u2019t wear a brimmed hat, sunglasses and remain in the shade and expect to \u201cwake up\u201d your circadian clock.\n\n2) Wake up at the same time each day and go to sleep when you first start to feel sleepy. Pushing through the sleepy late evening feeling and going to sleep too late is one reason people wake at 3 am and can\u2019t fall back asleep.\n\n3) Avoid caffeine within 8-10 hours of bedtime. \n\n4) Avoid viewing bright lights\u2014especially bright overhead lights between 10 pm and 4 am. Here is a simple rule: only use as much artificial lighting as is necessary for you to remain and move about safely at night. Blue blockers can help a bit at night but still dim the lights. Viewing bright lights of all colors are a problem for your circadian system. Candlelight and moonlight are fine. \n\n5) Limit daytime naps to less than 90 min, or don\u2019t nap at all. \n\n6) If you wake up in the middle of the night (which, by the way, is normal to do once or so each night) but you can\u2019t fall back asleep, consider doing an NSDR protocol when you wake up. \n\n7) Keep the room you sleep in cool and dark and layer on blankets that you can remove.\nYour body needs to drop in temperature by 1-3 degrees to fall and stay asleep effectively. Body temperature increases are one reason you wake up. Thus, keep your room cool and remove blankets as needed. If it\u2019s too hot you would have to use a cooling device and that\u2019s harder than simply tossing off blankets if you get too warm.\n\n8) Drinking alcohol messes up your sleep. As do most sleep medications.\n\n9) Kids have changing sleep needs over time. Adjust accordingly.\nTeens might be night owls at 15 but become \u201cmorning people\u201d as they age or need 6 hours a night in summer and 7-8 in winter. It will vary."

It was a period of economic depression that became evident after a major fall in stock prices in the United States. The economic contagion began around September and led to the Wall Street stock market crash of October 24 (Black Thursday). It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century.\n\nBetween 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession. Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s.

        "output": "Orange wine was first introduced in Georgia and it dates thousands of years back. It is a variant of white wine where the skin grapes are not removed after crushing the grapes. Instead, the skins are left to ferment with the grape juice, similarly to red wine. The style of skin-contact white wine was adopted by Italian and Slovenian winemakers, after visiting Georgia. It then spread to other European countries. \n\nSkin-fermented white wines were common up until the 1960s, when fresh white wines started to dominate the market.\n\nThe term orange wine was coined only in 2004 by a British wine importer.\n\nIn Georgia skin-contact white wine is historically known as amber wine."

        "output": "Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in the cells in your body. Your liver makes cholesterol and it is also found in some foods like meat and dairy products. Your body needs certain levels of cholesterol to function, but too much raises the risk of  cardiovascular disease. \n\nLDL, low-density lipoprotein, is also known as bad cholesterol. It gets it's \"bad\" name because too high of levels of LDL can lead to a build up of cholesterol in you arteries.  The extra amount of LDL forms plaque and the build up of this plaque in your arteries leads to a condition called, artherosclerosis.  Coronary artery disease happens when the plaque buildup is in the arteries of your heart. It causes the arteries to become hardened and narrowed , which slows down or blocks the blood flow to your heart.  Because your blood carries oxygen to your heart, this means that your heart may not be able to get enough oxygen. This can cause angina or chest pains and may lead to a heat attack if blood flow is completely blocked."

        "output": "Agriculture is the backbone of the economy and the main source of livelihood for the majority of the population. However, traditional agricultural practices have led to soil degradation and deforestation. Farmers in Ethiopia often rely on a few staple crops, such as teff, wheat, and maize, which are grown repeatedly on the same plot of land without proper rotation or replenishment of soil nutrients (International Labour Organization). This leads to reduced yields, which can make it difficult for farmers to produce enough food to feed their families and earn a living. Deforestation, which is also a major problem, has been driven by the need for more land to grow crops. Ethiopia has one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, with an estimated loss of 1.1 million hectares of forest every year (World Bank)."

The allure of traveling to new and exciting places, the potential for airline and hotel program status benefits, meeting new people, etc.  All of these things may be exactly what you are looking for.  But my advice for anyone who is considering a position with significant travel and who has not experienced that type of work-life before is to think about all the things in their life that they are involved with that make them happy.  Think hard about whether you can take them on the road with you, reproduce them wherever your business travel takes you, or do without them.  Perhaps you have a standing poker night each month with your friends.  You may not be able to attend that with any regularity.  You may love the climbing gym or cycling club at home.  Can you replace that with hotel gyms?  Do you stick to a diet that will be hard to keep when you need to eat out a lot?  Do you have a relationship at home that will suffer if you are gone a lot?  The list can go on and on and is different for each person.  But it is critical to evaluate this aspect of how your life will change when you travel a lot of the time and make sure you are happy with the accommodations and changes you will need to make.  Another important consideration is whether you will be traveling to different time zones.  Often the idea of globetrotting to different parts of the world is very exciting, but you will have to deal with jetlag while maintaining your work performance.  You will end up dealing with canceled or delayed flights, traffic, and other types of travel disruptions.  Ultimately, a job with significant travel can involve a lot of excitement and fun.  But it is not right for everyone. It is not vacation travel.  And being honest with yourself about what changes you will need to make, what hassles you will need to deal with, and what you will have to give up will help you make the right decision.  And you will never truly know until you do it."

Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November.

This means that when white light hits the surface of the object, it is reflected back to the viewer as white. Titanium dioxide is a common pigment used in white paint, for example, because it is highly reflective and opaque.\n\nIn the digital world, white is often created by using RGB color values of 255, 255, 255, which means that all three primary colors (red, green, and blue) are at their maximum intensity.

        "output": "Home espresso machines are a growing segment of the small kitchen appliance market. A good home espresso machine provides the ability to make high quality espresso in a machine that is typically smaller and less expensive than their commercial counterparts. \n\nThere are three common espresso machine designs for home use: manual, semi-automatic, and fully automatic. As the name implies -- manual machines require direct \"manual\" control by the user, who typically applies pressure through a lever to deliver the desired brew pressure. Semi-automatic machines require the user to prepare the coffee into the portafilter, but then rely on an automated pump and to deliver the desired brew pressure for espresso. Fully automatic machines automate the entire process end-to-end: grinding the beans, loading the ground beans into the portafilter, and then pumping water through the portafilter at predefined pressure levels to brew espresso. \n\nManual machines typically have a lower cost, smaller footprint, and provide the user with more direct control over the brewing process. This allows skilled users to make higher-quality espresso than they would with a more automated machine. In contrast, fully automatic machines are often the easiest to use, but are unable to make espresso as consistently great as a skilled barista could with a manual machines. Fully automatic machines are inherently more complex, more expensive to purchase, and more likely to have longer-term reliability issues. \n\nRegardless of the type of espresso machine, two factors influence how well they will perform: their ability to manage brew temperature and brew pressure. The best machines provide the ability to vary brew temperature and pressure in consistent, repeatable ways.The type of coffee bean and desired result will impact what temperature and pressure profile the user wants. The best machines offer flexibility along both dimensions in consistent, repeatable ways."

Consumers can use an offset to track read messages.\n- Brokers: A Kafka cluster is composed of one or more brokers that manage the storage of messages in topics and serve as intermediaries between producers and consumers.\n- Producers: Applications that produce data and publish it to one or more topics in a Kafka cluster. They control how events are assigned to partitions within a topic.\n- Consumers: Applications that subscribe to one or more topics and consume published messages. The only metadata retained on a per-consumer basis is the offset or position of that consumer in a topic. This offset is controlled by the consumer.\n- Partitions: Kafka uses partitions to split a topic's messages across multiple brokers for scalability and performance. Events with the same event key, such as the same customer identifier or vehicle ID, are written to the same partition, and Kafka guarantees that any consumer of a given topic partition will always read that partition\u2019s events in exactly the same order as they were written.\n- Replication: Multiple brokers always have a copy of the data to guarantee high availability and fault tolerance.

        "output": "Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including biomolecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.[ The study of chemical and physical structure of biological macromolecules is known as molecular biology.\n\nMolecular biology was first described as an approach focused on the underpinnings of biological phenomena - uncovering the structures of biological molecules as well as their interactions, and how these interactions explain observations of classical biology.\n\nIn 1945 the term molecular biology was used by physicist William Astbury. In 1953 Francis Crick, James Watson, Rosalind Franklin, and colleagues, working at Medical Research Council unit, Cavendish laboratory, Cambridge (now the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology), made a double helix model of DNA which changed the entire research scenario. They proposed the DNA structure based on previous research done by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. This research then lead to finding DNA material in other microorganisms, plants and animals.\n\nMolecular biology is not simply the study of biological molecules and their interactions; rather, it is also a collection of techniques developed since the field's genesis which have enabled scientists to learn about molecular processes. In this way it has both complemented and improved biochemistry and genetics as methods (of understanding nature) that began before its advent. One notable technique which has revolutionized the field is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was developed in 1983. PCR is a reaction which amplifies small quantities of DNA, and it is used in many applications across scientific disciplines.\n\nThe central dogma of molecular biology describes the process in which DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into protein.\n\nMolecular biology also plays a critical role in the understanding of structures, functions, and internal controls within individual cells, all of which can be used to efficiently target new drugs, diagnose disease, and better understand cell physiology. Some clinical research and medical therapies arising from molecular biology are covered under gene therapy whereas the use of molecular biology or molecular cell biology in medicine is now referred to as molecular medicine."

It is a 16- to 18-day folk festival running from mid- or late-September to around the first Sunday in October, with more than six million international and national visitors attending the event. Locally, it is called d\u2019Wiesn, after the colloquial name for the fairgrounds, Theresienwiese. The Oktoberfest is an important part of Bavarian culture, having been held since the year 1810. Other cities across the world also hold Oktoberfest celebrations that are modeled after the original Munich event.\n\nDuring the event, large quantities of Oktoberfest Beer are consumed. For example, during the 16-day festival in 2014, 7.7 million litres (2,000,000 US gal) were served, making it the year where the most beer was consumed at the Oktoberfest. Visitors also enjoy numerous attractions, such as amusement rides, sidestalls, and games. There is also a wide variety of traditional foods available.\n\nThe Munich Oktoberfest originally took place in the 16-day period leading up to the first Sunday in October. In 1994, this longstanding schedule was modified in response to German reunification. As a result, if the first Sunday in October falls on the 1st or the 2nd, then the festival would run until 3 October (German Unity Day). Thus, the festival now runs for 17 days when the first Sunday is 2 October and 18 days when it is 1 October. In 2010, the festival lasted until the first Monday in October (4 October), to mark the event's bicentennial."

        "output": "In cancer, the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways. Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown point mutations in a variety of genes in cancer. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of human genome sequences and germline polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as oligonucleotide microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses (called comparative genomic hybridization), and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to detect known point mutations. These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome, and when used in high-throughput to measure thousands of samples, generate terabytes of data per experiment. Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians. The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or noise, and thus Hidden Markov model and change-point analysis methods are being developed to infer real copy number changes.\n\nTwo important principles can be used in the analysis of cancer genomes bioinformatically pertaining to the identification of mutations in the exome. First, cancer is a disease of accumulated somatic mutations in genes. Second cancer contains driver mutations which need to be distinguished from passengers.\n\nWith the breakthroughs that this next-generation sequencing technology is providing to the field of Bioinformatics, cancer genomics could drastically change. These new methods and software allow bioinformaticians to sequence many cancer genomes quickly and affordably. This could create a more flexible process for classifying types of cancer by analysis of cancer driven mutations in the genome. Furthermore, tracking of patients while the disease progresses may be possible in the future with the sequence of cancer samples.\n\nAnother type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of lesions found to be recurrent among many tumors."

It gathers various mathematical, statistical and image processing techniques that can be used to quantify morphological, hydrological, ecological and other aspects of a land surface. Common synonyms for geomorphometry are geomorphological analysis (after geomorphology), terrain morphometry, terrain analysis, and land surface analysis. Geomorphometrics is the discipline based on the computational measures of the geometry, topography and shape of the Earth's horizons, and their temporal change. This is a major component of geographic information systems (GIS) and other software tools for spatial analysis.\n\nIn simple terms, geomorphometry aims at extracting (land) surface parameters (morphometric, hydrological, climatic etc.) and objects (watersheds, stream networks, landforms etc.) using input digital land surface model (also known as digital elevation model, DEM) and parameterization software.[Extracted surface parameters and objects can then be used, for example, to improve mapping and modelling of soils, vegetation, land use, geomorphological and geological features and similar.\n\nWith the rapid increase of sources of DEMs today (and especially due to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and LIDAR-based projects), extraction of land surface parameters is becoming more and more attractive to numerous fields ranging from precision agriculture, soil-landscape modelling, climatic and hydrological applications to urban planning, education and space research. The topography of almost all Earth has been today sampled or scanned, so that DEMs are available at resolutions of 100 m or better at global scale. Land surface parameters are today successfully used for both stochastic and process-based modelling, the only remaining issue being the level of detail and vertical accuracy of the DEM."

Other options you have when making soap are to add essential oils, like lavender and grapefruit to give a nice scent to the soap.  This has to be added prior to saponification."

The King is just one of sixteen pieces that each player can use during the game. The other fifteen pieces include: Eight pawns, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and a queen. The pieces are placed on an eight by eight, square board in a fixed starting position. The game begins by the player using the white pieces moving one of their pieces to another square. Each player will then alternate playing one move turns. Each piece has a set of legal moves that it can perform. For example, a bishop can only move diagonally on squares of its same color, whereas rooks can only move vertically or horizontally. The goal of the game is to use your pieces in a strategic manner that ultimately leads to your opponent's King being captured. The most common way to achieve this is by using your pieces to capture your opponent's pieces that are defending the King, and then exploiting this weakness to attack the King. While it's important to play on the offensive, it's equally as important to understand your opponent's strategy, so that you can properly defend against their attempts to capture your own King."

Typically, until your baby is 6 months old, their diet consists exclusively of breast milk or formula.  Around 6 months old your baby may be able to start solids. You should consult your physician before modifying the diet of your baby.  Some people choose to introduce solids with soft, mushy and simple foods like mashed bananas, avocados or rice cereal.  Others will introduce whatever food is being served to the adults \u2014 this could be complex foods with spices such as fajitas, curries and hamburgers. Although young babies will rarely have teeth, their gums are very hard and can mash food. For example, a common early food is mini cucumber, which also may alleviate pains with teething.  For how to feed your baby, there are two main categories with many variations in between 1/ Baby-led weaning 2/ Spoon fed. Baby-led does what it sounds like \u2014 the baby leads their own feeding. This is often done by the caregiver laying out a few foods (Soft, Mashable, Age-appropriate and safe \u2014 void of choking hazards) and letting the baby choose which foods to pick up and eat and how much.

        "output": "Nihilism is a belief that life is ultimately meaningless. Sounds pretty depressing right? Well, there are a number of reasons why one might feel this way. Do you ever feel like you are just going through the motions each day? You wake up, go to work, get off work, sleep, and the cycle continues. You chased after a goal, such as graduating college or getting that next promotion, thinking it would solve all your problems, only to be disappointed after finally getting it. Then you look around the universe that you lives in and find how insignificant your individuality is in the grand schemes of things, you can't help but think to yourself: man, is there any point to life? Does what I do actually matter at all, especially if I'm going to die anyways? \n\nIf you ever feel this way, know that you are not alone. Many, many philosophers throughout human history have pondered upon this very idea. I'll present a select few philosophers and their proposals to fight against nihilism.\n\nOne obvious solution, per Danish philosophers Kierkegaard, is religion. He believes that faith should be our purpose in life, following Him and doing good in this life will reap rewards in the afterlife. \n\nNow, German philosopher Nietzsche does not agree with that at all; in fact his most famous quote was \"God is dead and we killed him\". He's talking about how with new advances in science comes the death of religion -- each man must now create his own values and become an ubermensch. The idea of ubermensch, however, kind of throws morality out of window \u2014 who is to say one\u2019s value is wrong?\n\nEnter Albert Camus and his idea of absurdism. He compares human life to Sisyphus \u2014 rolling a giant rock uphill, only for the rock to fall back down after reaching the top \u2014 an absurd and meaningless struggle. He suggests that we accept the absurdity of this world and human existence, and instead embrace the present, because \u201cThe struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy\u201d.\n\nAnd there you have it, what nihilism is all about, why it happens and a few ways to fight against it. Note that this is a very extensive topic and what I covered here is only the tip of the iceberg, I\u2019d suggest reading up more if you're interested. Hope it helped!"

        "output": "Sometimes it is faster to take the subway and sometimes it is faster to drive a car. The answer for any particular trip primarily depends on the origin and destination of the trip. If the origin and destination are both near a subway station, then it is often faster to take the subway, especially if there is a lot of automobile traffic on the roads and you do not need to connect between subway lines. But if either the origin or destination, or both, are far from a subway station, then the total time for the trip may be dominated by the time it takes to get to and from the subway station on either or both ends of the journey; this may add enough time to the time spent on the subway so that the total trip end-to-end takes longer than driving the whole way."

        "output": "The core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between genes (orthology analysis) or other genomic features in different organisms. It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion. Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and endosymbiosis, often leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectrum of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, heuristics, fixed parameter and approximation algorithms for problems based on parsimony models to Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for Bayesian analysis of problems based on probabilistic models.\n\nMany of these studies are based on the detection of sequence homology to assign sequences to protein families."

Post the harvest, in order to prepare the fields for sowing again they burn the left over rice husk and dried plants.  The month of November marks the onset of winter in the north Indian plains and during this time the north westerly winds stop.  The combination of high vehicle number, large scale burning of post harvest leftover and onset of winter with no winds results in the months of Nov-Dec being the most polluted in the year."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Not all planets and moons are round. There is some variety in their shapes depending on their masses, and curiously looking worlds might even exist, unlike anything we know from our system.\n\nEverything within a planet or a moon is under the influence of gravity in such a way that bits of it would move to the center if they could. Under ideal conditions, it would acquire a spherical shape. For objects made of something other than liquids, it varies at what point they become round. It is generally assumed that they mostly become spheres around 400 kilometers/248 miles in diameter when made from icy material commonly found in our Solar System. Still, if something is made from something more rigid, it needs to be larger in diameter than that - around 750 km/466 miles. At a sufficient mass, even rock becomes fluid-like. The moon of Mars Deimos is only 12.6 km/7.8 miles across and is not spherical, and there are many other small moons of other planets that don\u2019t have a round shape.\n\nThis, however, is not all. Astronomical objects spin, giving them the flattened shape of a sphere the faster their rotation if they are massive enough. On top of it, they can have moons. This causes a bulge to form at the position of their orbiting body around them. In the case of Earth, our Moon causes tides via this process. Also, our Sun gives our planet tides. Elsewhere in the Universe, there could be planets with massive moons or two similarly massive planets, called double planets, orbiting their common center of mass, the barycenter, at a close distance, which can cause even stronger bulging. Their shape would be affected this way more visibly.\n\nFinally, a bizarre, toroidal planet, shown above, can be stable from what we know from physics, at least for a while. As I mentioned earlier, even rigid rock behaves like a fluid at large masses. An adequate rotation speed can counterbalance the strength of gravity with centrifugal acceleration, and a torus-shaped planet could exist. A possible scenario for such a world to come to be would be if two sufficiently fast rotating planets collided and formed a doughnut of vaporized rock, a so-called synestia.\n\nWe currently think that the events that would lead to the formation of a world of this shape are so unlikely that there might not be a single toroidal planet in the Visible Universe, but we were quite a few times surprised by what we discovered during our exploration of Cosmos. Perhaps we will even find a doughnut shape world one day."

        "input": "",
        "output": "If you're a beginner tennis player, you should pick a racket that will help you learn the game quickly. There are a few key factors to consider. The first factor is grip size. There are several ways to measure grip size, but the simplest is to hold the grip and ensure there is about a finger's width remaining between your ring finger and base of your thumb when you hold the racket. Too small a grip may lead to squeezing the racket too hard, and too large a grip will make the racket unwieldy. The second factor is the weight of the racket. A racket in the range of 250 to 310 grams (unstrung) will be suitable for most players. A beginner male player might shoot for something in the 280-305 gram range, and a beginner female might use a racket in the 275-300 gram range. Junior players (age 10+), depending on age and size, should consider rackets in the 250 to 300 gram range. The third factor is the racket head size. You should look for a 100-105 square inch head size. These days even professionals use 100 sq inch commonly, and 95 is considered small (for advanced players). The racket composition is not a key differentiator, as most rackets are made of some sort of graphite composite material. Price is also not an indication of quality. Pricier rackets might be less suited to beginners, in fact. As to brand, it's a very personal choice. I would say choose a brand that you associate with wanting to play (perhaps you're a fan of a player who is sponsored by that brand). You can certainly find rackets at many big box retailers that would check all these boxes. And if you're not sure -- many online as well as local racket retailers run \"demo\" programs allowing you to try different rackets. Choose one that helps you consistently make contact with the ball and get it over the net. The most important thing is to get out on the court and play!"

        "output": "The size of tree has a direct correlation on how old the tree is.  The wider the diameter and circumference of the tree the older it is.  When a tree is cut down there will be inner rings in the stump that describe the tree's age as well.  A tree's diameter will increase in size about 2.5 centimeters per year.  You can estimate the age of a tree by measuring the circumference of the tree in centimeters and then dividing it by 2.5 centimeters.  It will be important to measure as close to the ground as possible to get the most accurate measurement for the tree's age."

For one type of common investment income i.e long term capital gains, the tax rates are 0%, 15% and 20% based on the annual income of the individual. The income used for calculating the above rates doesn't include income from the long term capital gains itself. For example, if an individual makes less than $41,675 for the year 2022 through regular income, his or her capital gains tax rate would be 0% even if the long term capital gains itself is more than a million dollars. Assuming many of these high net-worth individuals don't have any regular income and all their income is through long term capital gains, they end up paying no taxes at all."

There are several methods you can use to sleep train your baby including the \"cry it out\" method, which works by allowing your child to cry while checking in on them incrementally to make sure they know you're there. When using the cry it out method, you need to ensure that all of your baby's needs have been met. Make sure your child is fed, changed, burped, and is overall comfortable. You can use words like \"it's sleepy time\" to signal your baby to sleep.

The field is analogous to genomics and proteomics, which are the study of the genome and proteome of a cell. Epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell's DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenomic maintenance is a continuous process and plays an important role in stability of eukaryotic genomes by taking part in crucial biological mechanisms like DNA repair. Plant flavones are said to be inhibiting epigenomic marks that cause cancers. Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and tumorigenesis. The study of epigenetics on a global level has been made possible only recently through the adaptation of genomic high-throughput assays."

But in both cases, the application allows you to organize emails by using filters or rules to automatically store them in a particular folder or apply a specific label for easy retrieval at a later time. The key distinction, however, is that an email can belong to only one folder at a time i.e., a 1-1 relationship, whereas a variety of labels can be applied on a single email i.e., a 1-many relationship. I love using email filter rules just as much as anyone that's interested in taming their email Inbox. But I sometimes find myself not reading an important email either until it's very late or end up missing it entirely because the email skips the Inbox (where I spend most of my time) when a rule is triggered. And that drives me nuts. I hear you saying, \"then why don't you edit the rule so that the email does not skip the inbox when it is triggered?\". And to that I would respond, \"then wouldn't that defeat the purpose and original intent of the rule? What's the point of creating a rule if all your emails end up in the Inbox view?\". That, in essence, is my biggest pet peeve when using email filters to organize my Inbox."

Dogs will seek comfort from their human when they feel anxious or are in physical distress. Dogs often seek approval from their human by performing specific tasks in which they have been trained, or by exhibiting character traits or behaviors that they have been selectively bred for. Dogs love humans and interact with them in complex ways. Humans, in turn, interact with dogs and receive emotional satisfaction."

The oceans that stretch from Northern California through to Mexico provide a rich wildlife habitat and amazing surf spots.  The Sierras, the mountain range a short drive away, allow for skiing and snowboarding for a majority of the year at locations that have been home to the Winter Olympics. The Central Valley is the home of farmlands and ranches and seem to stretch for miles. California provides natural wonders from forests to desserts to mountain peaks. \n\nCalifornia's climate in most parts is mild throughout the year. It is joked about by many, that it has one season. However, with the onset of global warming the weather patterns have seen a change.  The extreme droughts have been followed by extreme rain and flooding.  Although there has been more extreme weather across the globe, California still has a predominantly mild climate for a majority of the year making it a top destination for those looking for sunshine.\n\nCalifornia has been known as the Golden State.  It has provided golden opportunities for many who have come from all over the world to make their dreams come true. During the Gold Rush in the 1800s, miners came in from all over to find gold nuggets in the Sacramento Valley. Hollywood, the home of movies and television for the world, has been the mecca of many young person looking to find success in acting and celebrity since the early 1900s.  Silicon Valley has birthed some of the most successful companies in the world, showcasing the talents of students and entrepreneurs, changing the trajectory and pace of innovation. California is the home to many of the most transformative companies providing a wealth of job opportunities. California is the showcase of the American dream. \n\nOne can spend years visiting landmarks and interesting locations in California. The Golden Gate Bridge is a must see in San Francisco, it is one of the most historic bridges and the doorway to the San Francisco Bay. Yosemite is a glorious national park and home to gorgeous waterfall, hiking and Half Dome. Along the coast, visiting Big Sur is a must, showcasing the sky high redwoods and a priceless view of the coastline. Palm Springs provides a fun dessert location that is the home to music festivals, incredible golfing and natural hot springs. Another point of interest, Lake Tahoe, a gorgeous Lake that is truly breath taking.  It is surrounded by mountains of snow in the winter and the home to water skiers in the summer. This is just a taste of the amazing locations California has to offer. \n\nCalifornia truly has a treasure trove of benefits for visitors and residents, however it has been struggling with issues that can threaten its future and make it difficult for those that choose to call it home. California has very high taxes for both residents and business owners.  The population boom has also created a lack of low cost housing, California is home to the some of the highest housing prices in the United States. The high taxes and high priced housing makes this state out of reach for many. Additionally, the state needs to work on investments in public education, infrastructure and homelessness which have all been suffering in recent years.\n\nDespite some of it's struggles, the Golden State continues to be golden due to amazing locations, an incredible climate, a diverse population and unmatched opportunity. California is a unique gem on the west coast for many to choose to live and visit."

        "output": "Space-based telescopes have the advantage of being above the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere. In addition, there are many wavelengths from the electromagnetic spectrum that do not reach Earth because they are absorbed or reflected by the Earth's atmosphere. Only the wavelengths of visible light, a portion of infrared, and part of the radio wavelengths reach Earth. To observe other parts of the spectrum - ultraviolet, x-rays, gamma rays or infrared, telescopes have to be outside of Earth's atmosphere. Studying gamma-rays for example, helps astronomers learn more about things like blazars, gamma-ray bursts, pulsars and solar flares than would be possible with just optical telescopes. Similarly, studying x-rays gives invaluable information about the very hot regions of the universe such as exploded stars, clusters of galaxies, and the matter around black holes. The benefits of getting clean, unblurred optical images as well as the ability to observe other parts of the spectrum are worth the expense of putting telescopes in space."

These expeditions are managed by a mysterious government organization known as the Southern Reach.\n\nThe expedition centers on two notable landmarks within Area X, the topological anomaly, which the biologists calls a tower but is really a tunnel, and a lighthouse. The expedition encounters an entity within the topological anomaly that \"writes\" living words of non-sense on the wall of the anomaly in fungus. \n\nEarly in the expedition, the biologist is contaminated by the fungus of the words in the anomaly, which grants her immunity to hypnotic suggestion, which the psychologist uses to control the other members of the expedition. The plot follows the biologist pursuing the psychologist in search of answers, leading a confrontation at the lighthouse. The psychologist jumps from the lighthouse, presumably forced to by the entity behind Area X, but lives long enough to confront the biologist. During the climax of that encounter, the psychologist shouts \"Annihilation!\" multiple times, and it is revealed that this is a hypnotic trigger word designed to induce suicide in the other expedition members.\n\nAfter the psychologist succumbs to her injuries at the base of the lighthouse, the biologist embarks on a journey north to an island that is possibly related to the disappearance of her husband, who was a member of the previous expedition."

In this form of training, you alternate between slow and fast tempos within a training session. You run through several repetitions alternating between fast running pace and trotting pauses. Depending on the target distance and speed, this training unit can be designed differently. A marathon runner goes through a different interval training as a 800 meter runner.\nAnother way to train and increase the running speed are tempo runs. Here you run at a higher pace than the actual target pace. The intensity of the load is correspondingly high, the duration of the load and the distance is therefore shorter.\nOverall, however, it is important to remember that base training is just as important for increasing race speed as fast tempo sessions. With long runs, the appropriate foundations are laid in order to build them up with the previously mentioned speed units."

        "output": "Despite a rich cricket tradition in New Zealand, the country only became a test playing nation during the season of 1929/30, when the MCC toured the country playing 4 tests. Australia, the nearest test playing country to New Zealand, refused to grant Test status to any games played between the two nations until well after World War 2. This lack of test opportunities led to a now common path of talented New Zealanders moving off shore for the chance to play test cricket- most notably in the pre WWII period of Clarrie Grimmet, who took over 200 test wickets playing for Australia. Since then, Andrew Caddick (234 test wickets at an average of 29.91) and Ben Stokes (5000+ test runs and 196 test wickets) have played leading roles for England in tests.\n\nIf however we define the question as \"the best test cricket player to have played for New Zealand\", then there are perhaps only 3 or 4 candidates that feature. Of the current generation, there is no doubt that Kane Williamson will one day be regarded as the greatest player to have come from New Zealand- with over 8000 test runs at an average north of 50. With many years in front of him, Williamson will no doubt hold the crown of best test cricketer in years to come. \n\nMartin Crowe must likewise be regarded in the pantheon of test greats to have played for New Zealand- despite a slow start to his career, and injuries curtailing his time in the team, he amassed over 5000 runs at an average of over 45.\n\nHowever, most will agree that the most influential cricketer ever to play test cricket for New Zealand was Sir Richard Hadlee- the first cricketer to be knighted whilst still playing cricket for his country. Hadlee's bowling average of 22.29 is one of best in test cricket history, and at the time of his retirement he held the record for test wickets, at 431. Gaining 5 wickets in an innings 36 times was also a record, and led New Zealand to some of it's most famous test victories, notably victory in a series in Australia for the first time in 1985/86, with his best test figures of 15 for 123 coming in the first test at the Gabba. Added to his bowling, his destructive lower order batting made his one of the preeminent all rounders of the game., and truly NZ's best test cricketer."

        "input": "",
        "output": "When a baby is ready for potty training depends on several factors.  There is no universal answer or age that a child is ready to be potty trained.  However, some signs that a child is ready to be potty trained are signaling and/or awareness of when a child is or needs to eliminate waste.   Another factor is when the care taker has the time to dedicate to consistent practice of eliminating in a toilet instead of a diaper. Infant potty training also known as elimination communication is the practice of skipping the reliance of the usage of diapers.  In this practice, the caretaker will teach signs to the baby every time the baby eliminates in the toilet (not in a diaper) - the baby will eventually pick up these signs and give cues when they need to go.  Those that subscribe to infant potty training believe that conventional diapers train babies to ignore their natural instincts by removing the discomfort one would normally sense from having wet skin (achieved by chemicals that absorb liquid and wick moisture away from the skin found in many disposable diapers).  While infant potty training takes a lot of upfront attention and discipline, young children can be fully potty trained by 9-16 months of age.  On the other hand, potty training children that have been in diapers are usually potty trained by about 36 months of age.  There are considerable convenience trade offs to both methods."

        "input": "",
        "output": "McDonald\u2019s has more than 36 thousand locations in 190 countries, and people still cannot believe that McDonald's would soon put a period to the honorable accomplishment they did in the last several years making 4.73 billion dollars in a year as a whole. I do believe McDonald\u2019s disappearance would have some difference in some communities in the short term since there are 210,000 people working at McDonald\u2019s. And also, it can have environmental, and medical benefits that can make the world a better place.\n    The world is hugely affected by McDonald\u2019s action, which makes the disappearance of McDonald\u2019s could make the world a better place although it could have some negative influence on equality and education. Although McDonald's helps organizations that help people who lack education, suffer in poverty, or fight against discrimination, the positive impact of McDonald\u2019s departure makes the world a better place. For example, since McDonald\u2019s cut down the forest to build a cow farm, it can cause deforestation that is threatening the ecosystem and animal habitats. In addition, McDonald\u2019s produces 2 million tons of packaging each year. This means that the retirement of McDonald\u2019s could prevent habitat loss, deforestation, and even waste problems and have a huge, positive impact on the environment.\n    However, the change in McDonald's retirement causes would vary between different stakeholders, but overall, it would only have a mild, or little difference between people\u2019s lives. Although McDonald\u2019s disappearance might shock many people, after a short term, the other fast-food restaurants would replace McDonald\u2019s, so fast-food lovers could adapt to the new environment. Furthermore, although 210,000 people could lose their job, it is still possible for them to change to another job, or have an opportunity to change into another job that they have an interest in. Therefore, McDonald\u2019s disappearance could have little or no difference at all to some people, and withdraw from all the honorable accomplishments.\n    In conclusion, I think that the disappearance of McDonald\u2019s can make the world a better place for environmental, and medical reasons although it could have negative effects in some communities, and that McDonald\u2019s would not be forgotten by the joy and honorable achievements that they have achieved in the last few years."

No amount of expensive espresso machines can save a stale batch of beans.\n* Make sure your puck is evenly distributed. If needed, use a WDT tool to stir the puck gently from bottom to top, until you reach consistency.\n* Observe the brewing process closely and make sure the fluid flows smoothly. If the stream is unbalanced or side-splitting, check your puck and your machine's pressurization."

They are prized for their artistry, beauty and heritage and often command high prices today through luxury brands such as Rolex, Patek Phillipe and many others.\n\nQuartz watches, by comparison, send an electrical current through a quartz crystal, which causes regular vibrations that can be used to tell the time. This is why quartz watches require a battery. They are significantly less expensive that mechanical watches, and significantly more accurate due to the regularity of the vibration in the quartz crystal. Quartz watches are also distinguished at a glance by their ticking seconds hands, whereas mechanical watches have a smooth sweeping seconds hand."

For example, in the factories, robots have been widely used to make parts of machines, packaging product goods, or conducting accurate operations. Human has limitations in many areas, and those heavy labor jobs are usually replaced by robot machines. \n\nHowever, human beings still have very complex brain and nerve systems. AI development can try to approximate human beings, but can they ever exceed to achieve the limit? We will wait and see."

It then translates these virtual instructions run by the program into instructions that can be run by the underlying system or hardware. As one of the major design goals of Java from its origins was to provide portability of code, this capability allows all java programs to be compiled only for the specifications of the Java Virtual Machine, with the guarantee that those programs will run on any system or hardware platform that has an available Java Virtual Machine that runs on it."

Tiger Woods opened the door for an entire generation of young players coming from diverse backgrounds. This is a fundamental change to a sport that is historically a game of privilege and aristocracy. \n\nI would argue that the combination of having a winning record in Major events and having a significant cultural impact on the game makes Tiger Woods the greatest and most influential golfer of all time."

Essentially, someone with high EQ is very aware of how they are perceived, but just as importantly, they have an innate ability to discern others' feelings and motivations. Leaders with high EQ are interested in learning about what makes their employees tick, and they are aware that many people have completely different motivations. For example, a manager with high EQ understands that even though they may not personally be motivated primarily by receiving positive feedback, that if someone on their team becomes extremely motivated by praise for a job well done, they must make sure they are regularly delivering the kudos that employee thrives on.  In the past, there was a lot of focus on IQ, and while that can be a quality of a good manager, it is often more of the 'intangibles' of EQ and other personality traits that define an inspirational leader."

(Especially in American English, the word \"stocks\" is also used to refer to shares.) A single share of the stock means fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares. This typically entitles the shareholder (stockholder) to that fraction of the company's earnings, proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt), or voting power, often dividing these up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested. Not all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued for example without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other classes of shareholders.\n\nStock can be bought and sold privately or on stock exchanges, and such transactions are typically heavily regulated by governments to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the larger economy. The stocks are deposited with the depositories in the electronic format also known as Demat account. As new shares are issued by a company, the ownership and rights of existing shareholders are diluted in return for cash to sustain or grow the business. Companies can also buy back stock, which often lets investors recoup the initial investment plus capital gains from subsequent rises in stock price. Stock options issued by many companies as part of employee compensation do not represent ownership, but represent the right to buy ownership at a future time at a specified price. This would represent a windfall to the employees if the option is exercised when the market price is higher than the promised price, since if they immediately sold the stock they would keep the difference (minus taxes)."

        "output": "The Colossus of Rhodes may have been viewed differently by different audiences. The statue had an inscription identifying it as an image of Helios, the god of the sun and local deity to Rhodes. In the wider Ancient Greek world Helios would likely be identified more readily as Apollo. The statue may have been made in the likeness of Alexander the Great's official image. This would have served to represent a bond between Rhodes and Alexandria with Alexander's image serving as the founder of the Egyptian city. Support for this idea comes from the fact that the Colossus was made to celebrate Rhodes' victory over a siege. This victory was largely facilitated by Ptolemy from Alexandria, and Alexandria is also a likely source for the funds of the ambitious project. The artist Chares of Lindos would also have been well selected to achieve this double representation. He was local to the island of Rhodes (Lindos is another city on the same island) and would have been familiar with images of Helios. He was also the student of Lysippos who was the exclusive personal sculptor to Alexander the Great during his lifetime, and so Chares would have also been uniquely knowledgeable about the image of Alexander. Some but not all scholars argue for the Colossus to be understood as an image of Alexander posing as Helios that would be seen by the people of Rhodes as their local deity but seen by the people of Alexandria as their founder. The Statue of Liberty built by France and gifted to the USA was partially modeled after the Colossus and is similarly possible to read as a celebration of American independence and also a reference to one the three values Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9 and Fraternit\u00e9 central to French identity."

The player wins if the sum of the value of their cards  is greater than the sum of the value of the dealer's card. The the players sum of the value equals the dealers sum their value, then the game is a \"draw\" and a tie. A \"blackjack\" is when a player's first two cards total 21, and the player typically receives 150% the value of their bet. If both the player and the dealer have a blackjack on their first two cards, then it is considered a tie."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Bearded iris are one of the most popular perennial flowers in the American landscape.  They have attractive spiky foliage that is evergreen in many Zones and provide beautiful blooms multiple times a year.  They are cold hardy and are easily propagated and transplanted.\n\nThe best time of the year to transplant bearded iris is late summer.  This provides the plant with sufficient time to establish a new root structure before the winter.  Bearded iris grow from rhizomes, which quickly grow roots that provide the plant with the nutrients required to grow and form flowers.  The rhizomes should be removed from the soil using a garden fork making an attempt to keep as much root structure as possible.  The spiky leaves of the plant can be trimmed at this time to reduce the risk of the plant being disturbed by strong wind gusts when it is replanted.  Plant the rhizome in its new location so that only about a half of the rhizome is buried in the soil.  This enables the rhizome to receive direct sunlight and more vigorously replenish its stored starches and proteins."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins (usually abbreviated protein NMR) is a field of structural biology in which NMR spectroscopy is used to obtain information about the structure and dynamics of proteins, and also nucleic acids, and their complexes. The field was pioneered by Richard R. Ernst and Kurt W\u00fcthrich at the ETH, and by Ad Bax, Marius Clore, Angela Gronenborn at the NIH, and Gerhard Wagner at Harvard University, among others. Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy usually consists of several phases, each using a separate set of highly specialized techniques. The sample is prepared, measurements are made, interpretive approaches are applied, and a structure is calculated and validated.\n\nNMR involves the quantum-mechanical properties of the central core (\"nucleus\") of the atom. These properties depend on the local molecular environment, and their measurement provides a map of how the atoms are linked chemically, how close they are in space, and how rapidly they move with respect to each other. These properties are fundamentally the same as those used in the more familiar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the molecular applications use a somewhat different approach, appropriate to the change of scale from millimeters (of interest to radiologists) to nanometers (bonded atoms are typically a fraction of a nanometer apart), a factor of a million. This change of scale requires much higher sensitivity of detection and stability for long term measurement. In contrast to MRI, structural biology studies do not directly generate an image, but rely on complex computer calculations to generate three-dimensional molecular models.\n\nCurrently most samples are examined in a solution in water, but methods are being developed to also work with solid samples. Data collection relies on placing the sample inside a powerful magnet, sending radio frequency signals through the sample, and measuring the absorption of those signals. Depending on the environment of atoms within the protein, the nuclei of individual atoms will absorb different frequencies of radio signals. Furthermore, the absorption signals of different nuclei may be perturbed by adjacent nuclei. This information can be used to determine the distance between nuclei. These distances in turn can be used to determine the overall structure of the protein.\n\nA typical study might involve how two proteins interact with each other, possibly with a view to developing small molecules that can be used to probe the normal biology of the interaction (\"chemical biology\") or to provide possible leads for pharmaceutical use (drug development). Frequently, the interacting pair of proteins may have been identified by studies of human genetics, indicating the interaction can be disrupted by unfavorable mutations, or they may play a key role in the normal biology of a \"model\" organism like the fruit fly, yeast, the worm C. elegans, or mice. To prepare a sample, methods of molecular biology are typically used to make quantities by bacterial fermentation. This also permits changing the isotopic composition of the molecule, which is desirable because the isotopes behave differently and provide methods for identifying overlapping NMR signals."

Sir Walter is a widower who is conceited and selfish, and spends lavishly and beyond his means, which has forced the family to retrench by renting out their landed estate and relocating to lower-cost Bath.  \n\nAnne is wise and kind but, at 26, is past her prime.  At 19, Anne fell in love with, and accepted a marriage proposal from, Frederick Wentworth, a promising naval commander who is of a lower social status than Anne.  Anne is persuaded by her family (father and older sister) and close friend (Lady Russell) to break off the proposal.  \n\nThe novel starts with the family planning for their relocation to Bath, and the Elliots have coincidentally rented their home to the sister and brother-in-law of Frederick Wentworth, now a naval captain.  This provides Captain Wentworth with the opportunity to re-enter Anne\u2019s life and her social circle.  Captain Wentworth has achieved much success and wealth from his naval career.  While Anne immediately notices and admires Captain Wentworth, he initially remains cold to her and commented that she has aged significantly since he last saw her.  The plot takes various twists and turns, with other potential romantic interests for Captain Wentworth and Anne. As Captain Wentworth sees more of Anne, he learns to appreciate and respect her, and ultimately they fall in love again and agree to renew their engagement."

One resource allows you to enter in your address, and based on that address, it will show you what a sample ballot will look like.  This helps voters to see what positions or questions will appear on the ballot so that they can research them prior to voting. Providing referendum questions in advance allows voters to read through them to make sure they understand what is being asked, as the language used in these questions is sometimes legalistic and easier to process outside of the pressure of the voting booth. This website is provided by the Wisconsin Elections Commission, which is a bipartisan commission charged with implementing Wisconsin's election statutes."

That's because, while the experience of driving an EV may feel like a zero-compromise embrace of green energy, the vast industrial network needed to build and power EVs diminishes the halo effect. On the other hand, the fossil fuels that power traditional vehicles are definitely contributing to global warming and leave the world vulnerable to oil shocks and pressure from oil-producing countries. \n\nWhether EVs are better or worse for the environment is still to be determined. But a more insidious trend is the growing size and power of electric vehicles. Smaller vehicles, traveling fewer miles, represents a proven formula for reducing emissions and reversing climate change. But already, we're seeing the advent of electric trucks and SUVs, which are heavier, loaded with bells and whistles so they require more and more power to move people around. Coupled with the problem of drivers feeling like their EV gives them the right to drive as much as they want and you can see a reality emerging where the problem of Americans driving giant gas guzzlers is being replaced with American driving giant, power-sucking EVs. And that's leading us even faster down the road to environmental disaster."

When light travels through different mediums such as air , water or glass, its speed changes and change in speed causes the light to bend. This phenomenon is called refraction. Rainbow is an example of physical optical illusion caused by refraction.   \n\nPhysiological optical illusion occurs when a pattern repeats over and over again and it is too much information for the brain. This causes the brain to think the images are moving. Kinetoscope uses images to create a video using physiological optical illusion. Flip books are another example of physiological optical illusion. \n\nCognitive optical illusion occurs when multiple people view the same image but they interpret it differently. Interpretation of the image depends of people's past experience and personalities."

Depending on the settings of the camera, the depth of focus can be very small, ranging in millimeters or centimeters to very large - hundreds of meters. The most important setting that will determine the depth of focus is the aperture used in the lens when the picture is taken. The aperture is how widely open the lens is and how much light is allowed to pass through it. A low f-stop or big aperture will minimize the depth of field, while a high f-stop or small aperture will maximize it. Depth of field is an element that photographers use in composition to blur or sharpen elements of the photograph, thus emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain aspects."

        "output": "In 1725, Basile Bouchon invented punch cards, which communicate information in a machine language. The punched holes communicated a sequence of instructions and acted as on/off switches for devices such as self-playing pianos or looms. About a century later, Charles Babbage invented the first mechanical calculator, the Difference Engine using punch card instructions. Herman Hollerith continued developing this idea and made the Analytical Engine a reality by using punch holes to be a sequence of instructions and also store the instruction data on the device. In 1890, he developed a punch card data processing system for the US Census and went on to form the Tabulating Machine Company in 1896, later renamed International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). By the 1950s punch cards were being used regularly by the US government and industry.  Even today, punch cards are still used in standardized tests and voting ballots. Initially invented by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928, magnetic storage gradually replaced punch cards in the 1960s.  By 1965, Mohawk Data Sciences Corporation sold a key-to-tape magnetic tape device that was specifically marketed to replace the punch card. Cassette tapes started to become commonly used for most computers in the 70s and 80s. Fast forward to the 90s, affordable personal computers and magnetic disk storage replaced almost all punch card devices."

Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of biological queries using computational and statistical techniques.\n\nBioinformatics includes biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as specific analysis \"pipelines\" that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of genomics. Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidates genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Often, such identification is made with the aim to better understand the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organizational principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences, called proteomics.\n\nImage and signal processing allow extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw data. In the field of genetics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed mutations. It plays a role in the text mining of biological literature and the development of biological and gene ontologies to organize and query biological data.

These changes included a pitch clock, limiting the number of pickoff attempts.  To increase the amount of offense generated, they eliminated the defensive shift and increased the size of the bases, effectively shortening the distance between bases to encourage more stolen base attempts.  \n\nThrough the first week of the 2023 season, the average length of game is down to 2 hours, 30 minutes like the Minors, batting averages are up 15 points to .245, and the number of stolen bases doubled in comparison to the year before."

There is the thought is that the human body will self regulate what it needs instinctively.   The notion of self regulation applies to nutrients found in the food as well as the amount of food that the body need.  The mainstream alternative (especially in first world countries) is pureed foods prepared especially for babies. Those that subscribe to BLW believe that the downside of feeding babies baby specific food is that the practice teaches babies to ignore natural instincts because someone else is in control of what type and how much food to eat.  Some reasons people choose not to follow BLW are: the misconception that babies cannot eat solid food,  the convenience of prepared commercial baby food, generally accepted mainstream guidance on baby rearing, or the lack of awareness of BLW. BLW can also be quite messy as some of the food babies will handle are a function of exploration rather than for consumption and therefore end up on the floor."

These were partly destroyed in the 1814 Burning of Washington, then were fully restored within five years. The building was enlarged in the 1850s by extending the wings for the chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing. The massive dome was completed around 1866 just after the American Civil War. Like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches, the Capitol is built in a neoclassical style and has a white exterior. Both its east and west elevations are formally referred to as fronts, though only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries."

        "input": "",
        "output": "A progressive consumption tax would be a good substitute for a progressive income tax because it would produce greater economic efficiencies by promoting investment and savings while eliminating the income tax's disincentivizing of work. Unlike a sales tax imposed at the point of sale, a consumption tax could be structured to be progressive rather than regressive, by using a year end tax return to calculate 'net consumption' during a given tax year, with the return summing all sales of qualified investments and then subtracting all purchases of new qualified investments. The tax return then apply a progressive tax rate to the total net investment. Much of the complexity of the current tax code would be eliminated. There would no longer be a need for complex calculations relating to capital gains, based on the concept of 'tax basis' and other arcane notions. Complexities relating to tax beneficial retirement-related savings accounts would also become unnecessary. Investors would no longer be penalized for efficiency-driven portfolio rebalancing. Billionaires would not be taxed significantly if they live frugally, but they could be taxed at very high rates for substantial consumption. A billionaire who buys large yachts, multiple mega-mansions, etc. would pay high taxes. A billionaire who lives modestly would not. But the latter billionaire is keeping her money invested in the economy, providing resources that will further economic growth. Opponents of a consumption tax cite the fact that most consumption taxes are thought to be regressive. However, as perviously mentioned, the consumption tax could be structured to be progressive, and in fact could be structured to be even more progressive than the current income tax. The progressive rates could be based on wealth rather than the amount of annual consumption or income. It would even be possible to tax consumption at over 100% in the case of billionaires. For example, if someone had a net worth of over $10 billion, we could tax that person's consumption at 150%. Regressiveness concerns can also be addressed by exempting a large portion of consumption. Annual consumption under a certain level, say $30,000 per year, could be tax free, or taxed at a low sales-tax-like rate of, say, 5%. Most economists agree that a consumption tax would promote economic growth."

Kobe Bryant at 5 titles is also on the list.  But the most dominant player of his era in the 1990's, winning 6 titles in 6 attempts, was Michael Jordan.  Michael Jordan was considered one of the best two way players, excelling at both defense and offense.  So while some might not agree, Michael Jordan is always in the conversation for best NBA player of all time."

Companies can decide what goods and what quantities to produce, but also how much to spend on research and development or which workers to hire. A government can decide what share of the national budget to spend on health care or education for its citizens. Through tariffs, taxes and subsidies, It can also influence under which conditions and with which countries trade is conducted. Similarly, economic policies guide the regulation of carbon emissions. These choices are often limited due to scarce resources (e.g., money, time, information). \n\nEconomists study the drivers and impacts of choices. They help us understand the major social problems of our time - including climate change, inequality, and poverty. Effective solutions to these problems require the work of economists."

At this juncture, that is Karim Benzema of Real Madrid, who won the 2021/22 award after leading Los Blancos to the La Liga and Champions League double.\n\nOthers would say that the highest-paid player is the best. That would be Kylian Mbappe whose new PSG contract could see the French side shell out an eye-watering \u20ac630 million over the course of his new three-year contract he signed in the summer of 2022. Mbappe is thought to be the best young player in the game now, gracing the cover of the popular FIFA video game for the last two years.\n\nStill more could argue that the player with the most goals scored would be the best player. That would make Cristiano Ronaldo the top player in the world, with his all-time record of more than 800 goals for club and country. Right behind him is his rival Lionel Messi, who also has collected far more assists than his Portuguese counterpart. Young striker Erling Haaland may have something to say about that, however, as his incredible start to the Premier League season has seen him on pace to shatter the league's single-season goalscoring record.\n\nHowever, that seems to discount those who play other positions, like 2018 Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modric, whose midfield brilliance led Croatia to the last World Cup final, or 2022 Yashin trophy winner Thibaut Courtois, whose goalkeeping heroics earned him Man of the Match in the 2022 Champions League final."

Classic cross-country skiing involves a striding technique in which the skier keeps their skis parallel to each other and is best done in a narrow, groomed track. Skate skiing is considered more challenging to learn and involves a skiing technique that resembles the motion of ice skating and roller blading. Skate skiers also typically use a groomed trail but it is wider and smoother than the narrow grooves for classic skiing. Touring skis allows skiers to most easily ski off the trails on top of snow that has not been groomed."

In conclusion, awareness of death could only have emerged in combination with self-deception, so that the terror of death would be managed and diminished.

Carl is a good husband to point out that she needs to fulfill her \"Things I am going to do\" promise to herself, but does not realize how Ellie views the loss of the baby.\n\nCarl is stuck on the aspect of having the house on Paradise island. He thinks that Ellie never lived her adventures and never added to her book since her first wish never got fulfilled. \n\nWhen an adventure presents itself in the form of Kevin, Carl, still attached to the past, prefers to fulfill the perceived wish by Ellie. When he does get the home on the water fall, it is clear that he is not satisfied. He can say that the dog nor Kevin are his problems. But when he sits down in his beloved chair, and looks through Ellie book of adventure again, he realizes that Ellie lived her adventures. She had no regrets. Her life was an adventure. And just at the right time, Carl sees the message from her to live his own adventure, i.e. Kevin.\n\nThings become clearer for Carl. He is absolved of his guilt.

Yes you have dreams. But in day to day life, those dreams may not be achieved. Look for adventure. Look to live fully and without attachment to your dreams like Ellie did. Because, then, in living this full life, it just might be that your dream comes true. It just might be that the house is on Paradise island even without you trying like in the end of the movie!"

When his son, Dave, finished culinary training, Dave partnered with his sister Nancy to run the Chilton location.  Marty and Margie moved to start another MarCal's diner in the city of Brillion, WI.  The business thrived for many years, with Marty leading operations and being the primary cook, and Margie working as a waitress and running the front of the business, as well as the accounting. Sunday morning breakfasts were always busy, and one item on the menu Marty was particularly proud of was the potato pancakes.  The recipe for these pancakes came from Marty's mother, Eva Salm, who knew a thing or two about feeding a large number of people since she had to keep her family of 15 children fed, as well as their many farm hands.  MarCals restaurants no longer exist, as they were all closed at various times after Marty and Margie's retirement, but many a fond memory of Sunday breakfasts and lunch time buffets still remain."

Yeast can be used in the dough which will activate and the dough will rise over a number of hours (or even days) depending on the type of bread you are making. Another method is natural fermentation ie sourdough. Sourdough bread rises by using a \"pre-ferment\" or sourdough starter when mixing the dough. Typically sourdough requires a longer rise time for the development of the air bubbles and the sour taste by which the name comes from."

It is played with two teams of 7 players who square off against each other on a field that is about the size of an American football field (120x40 yards). Much like American football, the objective is to catch the Frisbee, or disc, in the end zone in order to score points. The run of play, however, is continuous like soccer. Players cannot run while holding the disc, requiring teams to progress down the field by throwing the disc to each other. Each player must release the disc within 10 seconds of acquiring it. Under normal circumstances, the first team to score 15 points wins."

The components are the router and the satellite dish \u201cDishy\u201d, and the cables that connect them. As long as the dish has a view of the sky in a location where starlink is available you will have internet access at a speed sufficient for video meetings.

The dough is made with four cups of flour, three tablespoons olive oil, a cup and a half of water, one package of yeast, a tablespoon of sugar, and a teaspoon and a half of salt. I typically activate the yeast in lukewarm water and sugar first, then mix all the ingredients in a stand mixer with a dough attachment. I'll add additional water until the dough is very wet, let it rise once in the mixing bowl, then turn the dough out on a surface coated generously with flour. Then I quarter the dough, fold a few times, and let rise again. \n\nForming the pies is the tricky part. I've found pushing the dough into a rough circle with my fingers as a first step works well, but he dough will tend to snap back. I'll pick up the small dough circle and stretch it out on top of my fists to start to break the gluten and form a larger pie with a thinner base. I use an Ooni oven pre-heated on high, but turn the heat down when I'm ready to put the pizza in. The peel needs to be generously coated with flour to get a good launch into the oven. After a few seconds, the dough on the bottom will cook enough that manipulating the pizza becomes much easier. I keep the toppings simple, mozzarella (low moisture), tomato sauce, basil. \n\nEnjoy!"

In both places, it's best to be walking to see the sights. In Yosemite you can hike or bike. In Venice you can walk or take a boat ride on the canals. If possible, one should visit both.

More touches theoretically means more opportunities to score points.  However, with recent NFL rule changes, stronger and faster wide receivers, and fantasy football scoring systems that provide extra points for catching a pass (catches) wide receivers are scoring significantly more points than running backs on a weekly basis.

If a car is said to travel at 60 miles per hour, its speed has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60 miles per hour to the north, its velocity has now been specified.\n\nThe big difference can be discerned when considering movement around a circle. When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its average velocity is zero, but its average speed is found by dividing the circumference of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle. This is because the average velocity is calculated by considering only the displacement between the starting and end points, whereas the average speed considers only the total distance travelled."

TED and TEDx talk videos are readily available for consumption, for free from the website www.ted.com, via a mobiule app, as well as on Spotify, YouTube and many other content platforms.\n\n2. Podcasts - Podcasts are a series of on-demand episodes, delivered orally, focused on a specific theme. Podcasts can be accessed from many types of devices and are readily available from many popular platforms, including Spotify, Apple Podcasts and iHeartRadio. Podcasts are focused on any number of topics, and can easily be listened to while on the go. \n\n3. Newsletters - Newsletters are printed or electronic reports that are made available by many organizations to a subscribed audience. They are often written in short, digestible formats to provide the highlights of a variety of topics, and typically contain links to learn more, if desired. They usually take only a few minutes to read and are readily available from news sources like the Wall Street Journal, CNN, Fox News, as well as many websites and LinkedIn groups. \n\nIn addition to these ideas, simply dedicating a small amount of time each day to learning and improving yourself can go a long way. Try to dedicate 15 minutes every day, ideally at the same time each day, toward this and before long, it will become a habit."

Microservices advocate for an event driven architecture where services are not coupled or referenced directly.  Each Microservice can publish events that can be consumed/subscribed by other services.  Containerization and Microservices go well together when designing Microservices, considering that the paradigm calls for Containers to be immutable and treated as Cattle.  New and Old versions of the same Microservice can be released side by side in an A/B pattern, helping with assurance of any updates.  Containers can host the Microservices quickly and be tested across environments with reliability ensuring all dependencies are encapsulated in the build of the running image."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Tubeless tire installs require some setup. It's best to have experience with bicycle tires, and in particular, the use of tire levers to remove and install tires. Make sure your tires and rims are tubeless ready. If the manufacturer also provides a tubeless tape, use that, or use a generic brand. You'll also need sealant and a tubeless stem. The stem might require a tool to unscrew the nozzle for adding sealant. You'll also need a large syringe if you plan on using the stem to add sealant. You'll want a electronic pump, or a manual pump with a reservoir.\n\nI have found that larger tires are easier to install as tubeless but road tires can also be tubeless. The first step is to clean the rim and install tubeless tape around the rim. This should seal the rim component. You'll need to punch a hole for the stem and insert the stem. Next you'll need to lever the tire onto the rim, first one side, then both. If you don't have a syringe, you can add some sealant at this step before fully installing the tire. For road tires, I've found this method prone to spilling.\n\nNext, remove the core / nozzle from the tire stem and hook the stem up to your pump. You want to inject air into the tire quickly and at high pressure to \"set\" the beads of the tire against the rim. This should result in a popping sound. When you remove the pump, the tire will deflate since you removed the core. If you haven't already, add sealant at this step using a syringe, then reinstall the core and pump up the tire. I usually rotate the tire a bit, then flip it periodically while testing if it holds air. If it does you are done. Happy riding!"

One could make a case for any of the following. Jerome Kern wrote more than 700 songs and wrote the music to \"Showboat\", one of the first Broadway musicals with a serious plot and themes. The songwriting team of Rogers & Hammerstein was the first to use songs to further the plot vs. break the plot for a song and dance. Their musicals are still enormously popular and performed constantly. They include \"Oklahoma\", \"The King & I\", and \"The Sound of Music\". Leonard Bernstein, while most known for classical music made a major contribution to musicals with the groundbreaking \"West Side Story\", an updated Romeo and Juliet story with spectacular music, every song a classic. Bernstein collaborated with Stephen Sondheim on this musical. Sondheim ushered in the modern-day musical in which shows might explore a theme vs. a linear plot. While he is often criticized for not having \"hummable\" melodies, his genius is undeniable, and he did have one bonafide hit with \"Send in the Clowns\". Jules Styne composed what is often considered the greatest musical of all time, \"Gypsy\". The dynamite songwriting team of John Kander and Fred Ebb composed the longest-running American musical, \"Chicago\" and the dark yet entertaining \"Cabaret\". Finally, while often criticized by musical-theatre purists as blatantly commercial, the success of Andrew Lloyd Webber cannot be denied. He composed the enormously successful \"Cats\", the longest-running Broadway musical of all time \"Phantom of the Opera\" and even into his 80's is still composing, with the recently opened \"Bad Cinderella\" on Broadway."

        "output": "Frying shrimp is very easy, and requires simple equipment and ingredients. \n\nUse shrimp that is U-15 or less.  Frying shrimp that are larger than U-15 will result in tough shrimp.  First, clean and devein the shrimp, and then set them aside.  \n\nThen, heat vegetable, canola or peanut oil to 375 degrees.  These oils have a high smoke point (this is the temperature at which the oil will burn and smoke), and are good choices generally for frying.   Use a cast iron pan if you have one, or another good quality pan that retains heat evenly and well.  \n\nWhile the oil is heating, prep the flour. The crispness of the shrimp will depend on the type of flour that you use.  All purpose flour is readily available, and results in a nice, crispy shrimp.  Using rice flour will result in even more crispy shrimp, although rice flour is available at Asian grocery stores and is not readily available at general grocery stores. Using corn starch will result in the crispiest shrimp.  For one pound of shrimp, use 2 cups of whatever type of flour (or cornstarch) that you would prefer, and season the flour liberally with salt and pepper, and add some red pepper flakes if you prefer a little bit of spice.  \n\nAt this point, dry the shrimp and dredge the shrimp in the flour in relatively small batches.  Set aside until the oil is ready.\n\nOnce the oil is at 375 degrees, put a few shrimp in the oil, being careful not to crowd the pan.  Too many shrimp in the oil will result in less crispy shrimp, as well as shrimp that is oily.  You should use your judgment on how many shrimp to add, depending on the size of the shrimp and the size of the pan.  The shrimp will take only a few minutes in the oil to be done, again depending on the size of the shrimp.  The shrimp will be done once it\u2019s no longer translucent.  For shrimp that is 21/25 count or larger, using a spider (which is a type of skimmer) will make it easier to get the shrimp out of the pan.

But some people don't like Blue Apron and other meal delivery services like Hello Fresh, Factor, and Dinnerly, because you only get the ingredients, not complete meals. So you have to spend time on meal prep. For completely assembled ready-to-eat meals, people like Freshly, Unity Kitchen, or Splendid Spoon. If you have young children, it's probably a good idea to order the ready-to-eat meals so you can save time. The pre-assembled meals may be more expensive, but it could really be worth it for a young family."

        "output": "The military can help pay for college in a few different ways.  If you are already planning to go to a specific school, you can check to see if they have a Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) unit at the school and apply for an ROTC scholarship.  An ROTC scholarship can help pay for most of your college degree, and you will have the option to join an active or reserve unit after college is complete.  You will likely owe about 4 years of service as an officer in return for the scholarship.  Another option is to go to a military academy.  Military academies provide full tuition in exchange for 5 years of service as an officer after graduation.  Finally, you could enlist in the military, serve 3-4 years as an enlisted soldier, and then use the G.I. Bill to attend college afterward.  The best choice for you depends on your college preferences, your financial situation, and the timeline on which you want to earn your college degree."

When going to sleep, the customer and their needs are the last thoughts that drift from your mind as you fall asleep. When waking up, the customer should be the first thought to naturally occur as you begin to consider your activities. When eating your lunch, you should imagine what your customer is eating for their lunch.\n\nWhen your customer is on your mind every waking moment, you've begun to walk the path of being customer obsessed. Once you've begun dreaming of your customer, then you will then have achieved true customer obsession."

        "output": "In genomics, a genome-wide association study (GWA study, or GWAS), is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait. GWA studies typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms.\n\nWhen applied to human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without the disease (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If there is significant statistical evidence that one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be associated with the disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that may influence the risk of disease.\n\nGWA studies investigate the entire genome, in contrast to methods that specifically test a small number of pre-specified genetic regions. Hence, GWAS is a non-candidate-driven approach, in contrast to gene-specific candidate-driven studies. GWA studies identify SNPs and other variants in DNA associated with a disease, but they cannot on their own specify which genes are causal.\n\nThe first successful GWAS published in 2002 studied myocardial infarction. This study design was then implemented in the landmark GWA 2005 study investigating patients with age-related macular degeneration, and found two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency compared to healthy controls. As of 2017, over 3,000 human GWA studies have examined over 1,800 diseases and traits, and thousands of SNP associations have been found. Except in the case of rare genetic diseases, these associations are very weak, but while they may not explain much of the risk, they provide insight into genes and pathways that can be important."

Each chromosome carries many genes, with each gene occupying a different position or locus; in humans, the total number of protein-coding genes in a complete haploid set of 23 chromosomes is estimated at 19,000\u201320,000.\n\nGenes may possess multiple variants known as alleles, and an allele may also be said to reside at a particular locus. Diploid and polyploid cells whose chromosomes have the same allele at a given locus are called homozygous with respect to that locus, while those that have different alleles at a given locus are called heterozygous. The ordered list of loci known for a particular genome is called a gene map. Gene mapping is the process of determining the specific locus or loci responsible for producing a particular phenotype or biological trait. Association mapping, also known as \"linkage disequilibrium mapping\", is a method of mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that takes advantage of historic linkage disequilibrium to link phenotypes (observable characteristics) to genotypes (the genetic constitution of organisms), uncovering genetic associations."

A second reason grandparents say their role is so special is they get to enjoy their grandchildren, and then return them to their parents who have the ongoing responsibility for raising the children. This creates a special bond between the grandparents and grandchildren that many grandparents describe as special.  A third reason many say it is special to be a grandparent is tied to an instinctive love they describe that they have for their grandchildren. You may hear them say, \"I loved this grandchild from the minute I heard they were conceived, and the love has nothing to do with any merit, just love because they are my grandchild.\"  Having this love for another is a key factor in why it is special to be a grandparent."

While some national parks are harder to access, most can be enjoyed by the majority of people. If you hate paying high entrance fees to destination locations the national parks are also a great option. You can get an annual pass for less than $100 which allows you to visit all national parks and many national forests and monuments at no additional charge. However, if you want to stay within the national parks make sure to book well in advance as campsites and lodging fills up quickly. For the most popular parks you'll want to book six months in advance when the reservations open up.

Our plan for the day was to infiltrate the Massif des Maures area and search for one of France's most endangered reptiles-- the western Hermann's tortoise.  The first stop of our quest was Le Village de Tortues (the Tortoise Village), a tortoise rehabilitation center near the town of Gonfaron. Our mission was to befriend a staff member, learn as much as we could, and get detailed information on tracking down the wily Hermann's tortoise in the wild. When we couldn't find an English-speaking staff member, our mission was nearly thwarted. Only through quick thinking and improvisation were we able to acquire the vital background information we needed. Okay - we utilized the signs provided for British visitors. For many people, the word tortoise invokes thoughts of giant four-foot-long Galapagos tortoises. Western Hermann's tortoises, on the other hand, are small, reaching a maximum length of eight inches. While both reptiles make the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the Galapagos tortoise is listed as \"vulnerable\" and the western Hermann's is listed as \"endangered.\" In France, habitat destruction, egg pilfering, and fire are the primary factors for the tortoises decline.",

        "output": "Strokes gained is a method of measuring a golfer's performance that revolutionized how people think about golf strategy and how they compare the performance of golfers.  \n\nSimply put, strokes gained measures how many strokes a player gains on every shot they hit in a round of golf.  \n\nFor example, if a player stands on the tee of a par 4 that is 375 yards long, their expected score for the hole for their skill level would be 4.0 strokes.  Assume they hit a strong drive of 275 yards, and land in the fairway.  Now their expected score for the hole might be 3.8.  Since their expected score went from 4.0 to 3.8 as a result of the drive, they gained .2 strokes with the drive.\n\nIf you repeat this for every shot in a round of golf, you would gain a picture of strokes gained for the overall round.\n\nOne key to strokes gained is what an expected score is for each hole.  This was first calculated for tour pro players when shot by shot stats were available via the ShotLink system used in pro events.  With the advent of consumer-level shot tracking systems, it is now possible to generated expected scores for virtually all levels of golfers, and thus any golfer can track strokes gained for their round, as compared to any level of golfer.\n\nStrokes gained is typically further broken down into 4 categories : Off the tee, approach, around the green, and putting.\n\nThe insights available once strokes gained was available has allowed insights into what really allows golfer to separate themselves from their competition.  Most notably, strokes gained was able to show that skill in driving is much more of a separator than is putting skill.  This went against many decades of conventional wisdom."

        "output": "The degree of importance of job training differs based on the government as job training is much more important in a capitalist economy versus a communist economy.  Assuming a capitalist economy, job training is important because of market dynamics, supply and demand.  In this case, demand are the available jobs and supply are the skilled workers who provide work in those jobs.  As technology advances, new innovations are made and cyclical market segments ebb and flow, the demand for highly skilled workers changes.  Upskilling is important as it helps workers to maintain valuable skills in their given field and the goal is to keep up with the technology advances in their respective field.  Reskilling is most often more closely linked to cyclical market forces where the demand for jobs in one field go down and another go up; reskilling is acquiring skills in the field with growing demand for jobs when a worker possesses skills in a field with declining demand for jobs or their skills."

Typically, a puppy can control their bladder one hour for every month of age. So if your puppy is 2 months old, they can hold it for about two hours. Don't go longer than this between bathroom breaks or they\u2019re likely to have an accident.\n\nTake your puppy outside frequently\u2014at least every two hours\u2014and immediately after they wake up, during and after playing, and after eating or drinking.\n\nPick a bathroom spot outside, and always take your puppy (on a leash) to that spot. While your puppy is relieving themselves, use a specific word or phrase that you can eventually use before they go to remind them what to do. Take them out for a longer walk or some playtime only after they have eliminated.\n\nReward your puppy every time they eliminate outdoors. Praise or give treats\u2014but remember to do so immediately after they\u2019ve finished, not after they come back inside. This step is vital, because rewarding your dog for going outdoors is the only way to teach what's expected of them. Before rewarding, be sure they\u2019re finished. Puppies are easily distracted and if you praise too soon, they may forget to finish until they\u2019re back in the house.\n\nPut your puppy on a regular feeding schedule. What goes into a puppy on a schedule comes out of a puppy on a schedule. Depending on their age, puppies may need to be fed two or three times a day. Feeding your puppy at the same times each day will make it more likely that they'll eliminate at consistent times as well, making house training easier for both of you.\n\nPick up your puppy's water dish about two and a half hours before bedtime to reduce the likelihood that they'll need to relieve themselves during the night. Most puppies can sleep for approximately seven hours without needing a bathroom break. If your puppy does wake you up in the night, don't make a big deal of it; otherwise, they will think it is time to play and won't want to go back to sleep. Turn on as few lights as possible, don't talk to or play with your puppy, take them out to the spot where they relieve themselves and then return them to bed."

        "input": "",
        "output": "GIS use has become mandatory in many settings. GIS are used to fight crime, protect endangered species, reduce pollution, cope with natural disasters, treat epidemics, and improve public health; GIS are instrumental in addressing some of our most pressing societal problems.GIS tools in aggregate save billions of dollars annually in the delivery of goods and services. GIS regularly helps in the day-to-day management of many natural and man-made resources, including sewer, water,power, transportation networks, and package delivery. GIS are at the heart of one of the most important processes in U.S. democracy, decadal redrawing of U.S. congressional districts, and hence the distribution of tax dollars and other government resources.GIS are needed in part because human consumption has reached levels such that many resources, including air and land, replacing substantial limits on human action.The first 100,000 years of human existence caused scant impacts on the world's resources, but in the past 300 years humans have permanently altered most of the Earth's Surface. The atmosphere and oceans exhibit a decreasing ability to benignly absorb carbon dioxide and nitrogen, two of humanity's primary waste products. Silt chokes many rivers, and there are abundant examples of smoke, ozone, or other noxious pollutants substantially harming public health. By the end of the 20th century, most lands south of the boreal region had been farmed, grazed,cut, built over, drained, flooded, or otherwise altered by humans. GIS help us identify and address environmental problems by providing crucial information on where problems occur and who are affected by them. GIS helps us identify the source, location, and extent of adverse environmental impacts, and may help us devise practical plans for monitoring, managing, and mitigating environmental damage.Human impacts on the environment have spurred a strong societal push for the adoption of GIS. Conflicts in resource use,concerns about pollution, and precautions to protect public health have led to legislative mandates that explicitly or implicitly require the consideration of geography. The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a good example. The ESA requires adequate protection of rare and threatened organisms. This entails mapping the available habitat and species range and migration patterns, relative to human land use. \nGIS use is mandated in other endeavors, including emergency services, flood protection, disaster assessment and management, and infrastructure development.Public organizations have also adopted GIS because it aids in governmental functions. For example, emergency service vehicles are regularly dispatched and route using GIS. E911 GIS matches the caller's address to the nearest emergency service station, a route is generated based on the streetnetwork and traffic, and emergency crews dispatched in a fraction of the pre-GIS times.Many businesses adopt GIS for increased efficiency in the delivery of goods and services. Retail businesses locate stores based on a number of spatially related factors. Where are the potential customers?What is the spatial distribution of competing businesses? Where are potential new store locations? What are traffic flows near current stores, and how easy is it to park near and access these stores? GIS are also used in hundreds of other business applications, toroute vehicles, guide advertising, design buildings, plan construction, and sell real estate.The societal push to adopt GIS has been complemented by a technological pull in the development and application of GIS. Thousands of lives and untold wealth have been lost because ship captains could not answer the simple question, \u201cWhere am I?\u201dRemarkable positioning technologies, generically known as Global Navigation SatelliteSystems (GNSS), are now indispensable tools in commerce, planning, and safety.The technological pull has developed on several fronts. Spatial analysis in particular has been helped by faster computers with more storage, and by the increased interconnectedness via mobile networks. Most real-world spatial problems were beyond the scope of all but the largest organization until the 1990s. GIS computing expenses are becoming an afterthought as costs decrease and performance increases at dizzying rates. Powerful field computers are lighter, faster,more capable, and less expensive, so spatial data display and analysis capabilities may always be at hand.In addition to the computing improvements and the development of GNSS, current \u201ccameras\u201d deliver amazingly detailed aerial and satellite images. Initially,advances in image collection and interpretation were spurred by World War II and then the Cold War because accurate maps were required, but unavailable.Turned toward peacetime endeavors, imaging technologies now help us map food and fodder, houses and highways, and most other natural and human-built objects. Images may be rapidly converted to accurate spatial information over broad areas. Many techniques have been developed for extracting information from image data, and also for ensuring this information faithfully represents the location, shape, and characteristics of features on the ground. Visible light,laser, thermal, and radar scanners are currently being developed to further increase the speed and accuracy with which we map our world. Thus, advances in these three key technologies \u2014 imaging, GNSS, and computing \u2014 have substantially aided the development of GIS."

Others were confused and disappointed that Bran Stark became king of the Seven Kingdoms (and ultimate winner of the titular \u201cgame of thrones\u201d), as there seemed to be little build-up or motivation for that narrative decision.

Other grips with two fingers together in the middle of the ball can be used for variations of movement on the cutter and experimenting with different angles across the holes of the Wiffle Ball will generate a cutter type movement.  The pitcher can throw with the same arm action as a fastball and allow the grip to create the late movement typical of a cutter."

        "output": "Chess is a game that is played on a checkerboard, which is composed of 64 alternating black and white squares that indicate where a player's pieces can be placed. There are six different types of pieces in chess, including: Pawns, Rooks, Bishops, Knights, a Queen, and a King. Each of these pieces can move on the board in different ways. The goal of the game is to utilize your pieces to capture your opponent's king. In a game of chess, players alternate turns moving one piece at a time. When a player moves a piece, they are either positioning the piece on an open square where no other piece is currently on, or they are capturing an opponent's piece. To win a game of chess, players will balance strategically positioning their pieces and capturing their opponent's pieces. Doing so will allow a player to have the opportunity to put their opponent in a position called \"Checkmate\". When a player is checkmated, it means that their King is in an attacking line of one or more of their opponent's pieces and they have no legal moves to escape this attack. If a player is checkmated, they have lost the game."

        "output": "These days, multiple industries are utilising GIS (geographic information system) as an integral part of how they do business. They use GIS to store, analyse, and quantify data with geographical information to show how it relates to other components.\n\nGIS compliments every industry. And forward-thinking companies recognise that with the ability to analyse information efficiently, they can optimise their efforts, use resources more efficiently, and have an advantage in their industry.\n\nThere are many advantages that a business gains when using GIS, and it is transforming industries such as utilities, infrastructure, environment management, and others:\n\nThe industries using GIS serve some of our most fundamental needs.\nEnvironmental Agencies\n\nGIS gathers and stores critical data for environmental agencies to track and monitor habitat, wetland, and coastal shoreline erosion, identify locations where threatened species live, water sources and other natural resources. It can also help to track patterns and help predict natural disasters, glacier changes and soil erosion.\n\nAll of the environmental data gathered is essential in helping with conservation, protection and restoration efforts. Other industries can also access and utilise the data collected by researchers and conservationists.\nUtility Companies\n\nOne of the most active users of GIS is the utility sector, and they use it to help with: \n\n    Managing grids and identifying patterns in customer usage, outages and supply issues\n    Tracking and monitoring pipelines\n    Locating water pipes and cables\n    Wireless networks\n    Construction planning\n    Monitor assets and field workers\n\nGIS, with its comprehensive database, helps to maintain and monitor overhead and underground utilities, improving efficiency and effectiveness and saving time and money\nInfrastructure Companies\n\nThe planning and development of our roads, electricity, water supply lines, buildings, and society\u2019s basic framework is mapped, managed, and monitored by companies that incorporate GIS in the infrastructure industry.\n\nGIS simplifies communications, improves efficiency and effectiveness for field workers, helps to monitor assets and workers, tracks and stores customer usage and issues, improves customer/client satisfaction, and much more.\nTelecommunications\n\nGIS is widely used in the telecom sector to help monitor real-time data about current use, outages, and signal strength to help them better understand customers\u2019 patterns and needs. \n\nThe telecom companies also use GIS to help optimise their resources effectively and efficiently, mitigate problems and plan for future growth.\nRetail\n\nRetail stores depend on knowing where their customer base lives or works and how far they are willing to travel to buy goods. GIS supplies essential data to help retail companies determine location, optimise inventory and sales, and plan their marketing campaigns to reach their ideal clientele.\nGovernment\n\nGeographical information is critical for the government to make decisions based on real-time data.  Government operations are spatial, whether for emergency response and management, fires, accidents, utilities, infrastructure, etc.\nAgriculture\n\nFood is a basic need for humans and animals. The agricultural industry uses GIS to help identify usable fertile land vs non-fertile land, weather hazards such as flooding or drought, and water supply.\nDevelopment and Urban Planning\n\nPlanners and developers rely on GIS to help them factor in several components when looking to build and develop an area. For example, they use GIS to find empty lots and determine resource and infrastructure availability and needs.\n\nGIS helps plan roads, housing, schools, businesses, government spaces, and hospitals. It also stores historical data, including ageing infrastructure, monuments, wetland areas, protected habitats, and species.\n\nAnother important factor is soil mapping, identifying possible hazards such as flooding, volcanic activity or other environmental issues.\nHealthcare\n\nToday, healthcare sectors use GIS to track disease patterns, whether an outbreak, an epidemic, cancer hotspots, or people in a specific location suffering from an environmentally caused illness. \n\nGIS has a disease surveillance system that can conduct a spatial analysis to locate which area is high-risk, and the GIS software is better are validating data.\nInsurance Companies\n\nMitigating and understanding risks ahead of time is essential to insurance companies, and they use GIS to ensure they are aware of possible dangers before giving you a quote."

His three laws of classical mechanics successfully predicted the behavior of solid bodies across all observable scales - from the motion of planets to falling apples. For over 250 years his laws were applied with greater and greater precision, always giving the correct answers.\n\nHowever, in the late 1800s physicists struggled to reconcile measurements of the speed of light with Newton's laws. This one of the observations that led to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.\n\nAlbert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born physicist who revolutionized our understanding of space, time and matter with his theories of relativity and quantum mechanics. His theories of special and general relativity changed our understanding of space and time and successfully explained the motion of light and the behavior of gravity.  His theories of quantum mechanics likewise revolutionized our understand of the sub-atomic world.\n\nIn addition to Newton and Einstein there are many other physicists who made groundbreaking discoveries,  including Galileo Galilei, James Clerk Maxwell,  Marie Curie, Neils Bohr, Richard Feynman, and Stephen Hawking."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The Federal Reserve has a \"dual mandate\" to both keep prices stable and maintain the highest level of sustainable employment. Controlling inflation falls into the scope of price stability. The Fed has three main tools to achieve this goal. First, they can change the Federal Funds Rate which is the interest rate used by banks for inter-bank lending and is the foundation for interest rates more broadly. An increase in the Federal Funds Rate, will cause interest rates to increase for loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc. The higher costs of interest rates cause prices to decrease. Second, the Fed can set expectations for path of the Federal Funds Rate via announcements from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and \"Fed Speak\" from individual Fed governors. These updates and commentary are based on the Feds marcoeconcomic forecasts and the individual opinions of the Fed governors. These expectations can influence the publics expectation for inflation and therefore the actual path of inflation. Lastly, the Fed has many technical tools for influencing credit markets and the interest rates on government bonds. These tools involve buying/selling US treasuries or providing assurances to select credit markets. These actions can tighten/loosen these credit markets and therfore indirectly influence actual interest rates. In summary, all three tools used by the Fed play a part in the strategy for controlling inflation."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Both VEX and FIRST have very strong robotics competitions for the high school level.  If you are a parent choosing between the two, multiple factors need to be taken into consideration.\nThe first factor is the availability of a robotics program in your area.  While you can form an independent team that is not affiliated with your school or another organization, it will require a significant financial and time investment.  At the high school level teams typically design their robots with CAD software and must machine the parts themselves.  Teams often consist of 20 or more members so that all of the aspects of the competition can be covered, such as creating and assembling the hardware, electrical wiring, systems design, programming and documenting the engineering process.  All of the parts and equipment need to be purchased and maintained, and members put in a lot of hours during the competition season.  Joining a pre-existing team that already has equipment, members and mentors familiar with a program will make it easiest for a child to participate, regardless of which competition the team is a part of.\nIf both VEX and FIRST programs are available, then it depends on how intense of an experience the child is interested in.  The VEX competition has a lower barrier to entry because it requires smaller robots.  Two pairs of robots compete against each other in a match to see which pair can get more points.  While teams will need to machine some parts and must have skills in electrical and software design, a team can be smaller and still compete effectively.  The FIRST competition involves much larger and more complex robots and challenges.  Two alliances of three robots each compete against each other in a match, with a total of six robots on the field at once.  Teams need to have more members to effectively compete, and participants need more in-depth training on hardware, electrical, system and software design.  There is also a business requirement, where teams have to create a marketing banner, brochure and video for their team to submit as part of the competition.\nWhether you choose VEX or FIRST, a child in high school that participates in a well-run robotics program will gain valuable engineering and organizational experience that will serve them well, both on a college application and after graduation."

Bligh and his men had just a small amount of food and water.  Bligh used his memory of navigation charts to plan a course westward to the Dutch colony of Timor.  \n\nThey initially tried stopping at an island to gather supplies.  The island was inhabited, however, and they were attacked.  One crew member was killed and the rest barely escaped.  From then on they dared not stop at any island until reaching the Great Barrier Reef of Australia (then called New Holland by the Europeans).\n\nIn a remarkable achievement of seamanship, Bligh and his men sailed and rowed their open boat for 41 days over a distance of 3618 miles, in sometimes harsh weather conditions.  Food and drink had to be strictly rationed, and the men suffered greatly from hunger and thirst.  Except for the death of the crewman at the hands of the islanders, all the remaining crew reached Timor alive.  Sadly, some men died of disease contracted at the colony town of Batavia or on the final return voyage to Europe.  Of the original nineteen men set adrift by the Bounty mutineers, twelve returned alive to England.\n\nBligh continued his career in the British Navy.  He was assigned a new ship and once again sailed to Tahiti take breadfruit to British colonies in the Caribbean.  This time, the mission was completed successfully.  Bligh commanded additional ships, including fighting in several major naval battles.  In 1805, Bligh was appointed Governor of New South Wales.  He ended his British Naval career as a Vice Admiral.  William Bligh died in London on Dec 12, 1817."

The three usages vary by how much of a complete software system the speaker is talking about.\n\nAt the lowest level, every Linux system is based on the Linux kernel \u2014 the very low-level software that manages your computer hardware, multi-tasks the many programs that are running at any given time, and other such essential things. These low-level functions are used by other programs, so their authors can focus on the specific functionality they want to provide. Without the kernel, your computer is a very expensive doorstop. It has all of the features of a modern operating system: true multitasking, threads, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, shared, copy-on-write executables, proper memory management, loadable device driver modules, video frame buffering, and TCP/IP networking.\n\nMost often, the name \"Linux\" is used to refer to the Linux Operating System. An OS includes the kernel, but also adds various utilities \u2014 the kinds of programs you need to get anything done. For example, it includes a shell (the program that provides a command prompt and lets you run programs), a program to copy files, a program to delete files, and many other odds and ends. Some people honor the request of Richard Stallman and the GNU Project, and call the Linux OS GNU/Linux, because a good number of these utility programs were written by the GNU folks."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The genome sequence of an organism includes the collective DNA sequences of each chromosome in the organism. For a bacterium containing a single chromosome, a genome project will aim to map the sequence of that chromosome. For the human species, whose genome includes 22 pairs of autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes, a complete genome sequence will involve 46 separate chromosome sequences.\n\nThe Human Genome Project is a well known example of a genome project.\n\nGenome assembly refers to the process of taking a large number of short DNA sequences and reassembling them to create a representation of the original chromosomes from which the DNA originated. In a shotgun sequencing project, all the DNA from a source (usually a single organism, anything from a bacterium to a mammal) is first fractured into millions of small pieces. These pieces are then \"read\" by automated sequencing machines. A genome assembly algorithm works by taking all the pieces and aligning them to one another, and detecting all places where two of the short sequences, or reads, overlap. These overlapping reads can be merged, and the process continues.\n\nGenome assembly is a very difficult computational problem, made more difficult because many genomes contain large numbers of identical sequences, known as repeats. These repeats can be thousands of nucleotides long, and occur different locations, especially in the large genomes of plants and animals.\n\nThe resulting (draft) genome sequence is produced by combining the information sequenced contigs and then employing linking information to create scaffolds. Scaffolds are positioned along the physical map of the chromosomes creating a \"golden path\".\n\nOriginally, most large-scale DNA sequencing centers developed their own software for assembling the sequences that they produced. However, this has changed as the software has grown more complex and as the number of sequencing centers has increased. An example of such assembler Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package developed by BGI for de novo assembly of human-sized genomes, alignment, SNP detection, resequencing, indel finding, and structural variation analysis.\n\nSince the 1980s, molecular biology and bioinformatics have created the need for DNA annotation. DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying attaching biological information to sequences , and particularly in identifying the locations of genes and determining what those genes do.\n\nWhen sequencing a genome, there are usually regions that are difficult to sequence (often regions with highly repetitive DNA). Thus, 'completed' genome sequences are rarely ever complete, and terms such as 'working draft' or 'essentially complete' have been used to more accurately describe the status of such genome projects. Even when every base pair of a genome sequence has been determined, there are still likely to be errors present because DNA sequencing is not a completely accurate process. It could also be argued that a complete genome project should include the sequences of mitochondria and (for plants) chloroplasts as these organelles have their own genomes.\n\nIt is often reported that the goal of sequencing a genome is to obtain information about the complete set of genes in that particular genome sequence. The proportion of a genome that encodes for genes may be very small (particularly in eukaryotes such as humans, where coding DNA may only account for a few percent of the entire sequence). However, it is not always possible (or desirable) to only sequence the coding regions separately. Also, as scientists understand more about the role of this noncoding DNA (often referred to as junk DNA), it will become more important to have a complete genome sequence as a background to understanding the genetics and biology of any given organism.\n\nIn many ways genome projects do not confine themselves to only determining a DNA sequence of an organism. Such projects may also include gene prediction to find out where the genes are in a genome, and what those genes do. There may also be related projects to sequence ESTs or mRNAs to help find out where the genes actually are."

A common view is that the U.S. won the Cold War because its capitalist economic system, characterized by free markets and the recognition of private property rights, was able to outperform the USSR's centrally-planned economy. The United States could therefore afford to spend more on its military than the USSR and won the nuclear arms race, which contributed to the internal collapse of the Soviet economy and the subsequent breakup of the Soviet Union into smaller, individual states with democratic elections. Additionally, though the USSR and the United States never officially engaged in direct military conflict with one another during the Cold War, various factions supported by the United States and its Western allies were able to successfully defeat Soviet-backed factions in proxy wars that took place all across the globe (with the notable exception of Vietnam). These defeats gradually limited the USSR's ability to project its power on the world stage, and helped the United States build and strengthen key alliances, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Finally, the United States carried out effective intelligence, counter-intelligence, disinformation and propaganda campaigns that undermined the faith the USSR's population had in its government and buttressed support for the U.S. government's efforts domestically. By 1991, the Soviet Union had fallen and the U.S. had achieved global hegemony."

It is the oldest organized sport in North America,[ with its origins with the indigenous people of North America as early as the 12th century.The game was extensively modified by European colonists, reducing the violence, to create its current collegiate and professional form.\n\nPlayers use the head of the lacrosse stick to carry, pass, catch, and shoot the ball into the goal. The sport has four versions that have different sticks, fields, rules and equipment: field lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box lacrosse and intercrosse. The men's games, field lacrosse (outdoor) and box lacrosse (indoor), are contact sports and all players wear protective gear: helmet, gloves, shoulder pads, and elbow pads. The women's game is played outdoors and does not allow body contact but does allow stick to stick contact.The only protective gear required for women players is eyegear, while goalies wear helmets and protective pads. Both men's and women's field lacrosse have 6v6 versions played on smaller fields, gaining acceptance in multi-sport events. Intercrosse is a mixed-gender non-contact sport played indoors that uses an all-plastic stick and a softer ball.\n\nThe modern sport is governed by World Lacrosse and is the only international sport organization to recognize First Nations bands and Native American tribes as sovereign nations.The organization hosts the World Lacrosse Championship for men, the Women's Lacrosse World Cup, the World Indoor Lacrosse Championship for box lacrosse, and the Under-19 World Lacrosse Championships for both men and women. Each is held every four years. Lacrosse at the Summer Olympics has been contested at two editions of the Summer Olympic Games, 1904 and 1908.It was also held as a demonstration event at the 1928, 1932, and 1948 Summer Olympics."

One of the biggest challenges when using crutches is that they make it difficult to carry items from one place to another, because your hands are always holding the crutches. To overcome this challenge, it can be useful to have a backpack or a bag to help you carry things around while holding onto the crutches. Walking for long periods of time with crutches can also make your hands feel sore because they are not used to bearing your bodyweight for very long.

Specifically, in the context of business intelligence, you are typically presenting facts and insights about a business to stakeholders in order for them to take action and make better decisions to run that business. \n\nGood data visualisation combines user experience design with an understanding of how people interpret data to provide something intuitive and compelling for the intended audience to use. \n\nHere are some examples of design and interpretation choices you might make:\n\nIn terms of design, many cultures write on a page from top to bottom, left to right. This means that the first place on any visualisation that a person from any of these cultures will look is top left. Consequently, the content you put in the top left space of your dashboard should be a critically important part of the story you are trying to tell. In a culture that writes right to left you might put higher-value content on the right-hand side of the visualisation. \n\nIn terms of in terms interpretation you want to key into things that people are naturally good at interpreting. For example, if you are presenting sales by product category and you have 10 product categories you could choose to leverage a bar chart where the length of the bar represents sales or a pie chart where the angle of the slice represents sales. A bar chart would be a better choice because people find it easy to compare the length of a bar. We cannot distinguish between the sizes of a slice with anywhere near the same level of accuracy. Choosing a pie chart would leave your users spending more time and effort interpreting your data visualisation than if you had chosen a bar chart to present the information to them."

Genome-wide association studies are a useful approach to pinpoint the mutations responsible for such complex diseases. Through these studies, thousands of DNA variants have been identified that are associated with similar diseases and traits. Furthermore, the possibility for genes to be used at prognosis, diagnosis or treatment is one of the most essential applications. Many studies are discussing both the promising ways to choose the genes to be used and the problems and pitfalls of using genes to predict disease presence or prognosis.\n\nGenome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of common genetic variants for complex diseases and traits; however, these common variants only explain a small fraction of heritability. Rare variants may account for some of the missing heritability. Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies have rapidly sequenced millions of whole genomes, and such studies have identified hundreds of millions of rare variants. Functional annotations predict the effect or function of a genetic variant and help to prioritize rare functional variants, and incorporating these annotations can effectively boost the power of genetic association of rare variants analysis of whole genome sequencing studies. Some tools have been developed to provide all-in-one rare variant association analysis for whole-genome sequencing data, including integration of genotype data and their functional annotations, association analysis, result summary and visualization. Meta-analysis of whole genome sequencing studies provides an attractive solution to the problem of collecting large sample sizes for discovering rare variants associated with complex phenotypes."

        "output": "When an airplane engine starts, the propeller creates thrust and pulls the airplane forward.  As the airplane moves forward, more and more air moves over the wing.  The airplane wings are designed to be curved over the top and flat across the bottom.  As a result, the air molecules take longer to travel over the top of the wing than they do on the underside.  This creates a differential in air pressure between the top and bottom of the wing.  The difference in air pressure is called Lift.  As thrust increases and pulls the plane forward, the lift eventually increases enough to overcome the weight and drag and the airplane will take flight."

Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.\n\nAuroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionisation and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles."

The reason for the order of events is that they proceed from more to less dangerous, so that the triathlete (as a triathlon participant is called) is most fresh and well-rested when they swim (so as to avoid drowning) and most exhausted during the run, when it is relatively less dangerous to make a mistake than it would be in the water or on a bicycle. Triathlons differ based on distance and terrain. They can be as short as a sprint event, which might include a swim as short as a single lap in a pool, or as long as an ironman triathlon, which includes a 2.4-mile swim, 112 miles of biking, and a full marathon. A common triathlon distance in between a spring and ironman is the olympic triathlon, which includes a 1.5-kilometer swim, 40 kilometer bike ride, and 10 kilometer run. Triathlons can take place anywhere where it is possible to do all three activities, including near a swimming pool, lake or open ocean.

A good analogy of antioxidants in water is the following: ORP is like a big swimming pool of potential but at the moment its currently empty and dissolved hydrogen is like ball of finite size.  The larger the ORP 'swimming pool' the more dissolved hydrogen 'balls' can fit in that pool.  An ORP with a large negative value is huge swimming pool, and an OPR with a high positive value is no swimming pool.  ORP can also measure whether water is acidic or alkaline.

In the United States, we have a system with two levels, a federal or national government, and underneath that state governments.  Dual federalism is a period between 1819 and 1936 where there was a clear separation of powers between the federal government and the state governments.  During this time the \u201cnational government left the states largely to their own devices in major policy areas\u201d which included \u201ceducation, transportation, and civil rights, among others\u201d.  \nDuring the dual federalism period, two important cases set the stage for the next time period called \u201ccooperative federalism\u201d (1936-present).  The first case was McCulloch v. Maryland which cited the Constitution's  supremacy clause and implied powers of the federal government in a verdict that prohibited the state of Maryland from taxing a federal bank.  The second case was Gibbons v. Ogden which cited the power of the federal government to regulate interstate commerce giving Gibbons a monopoly to ferry people from New Jersey to New York.  These two cases were used by the Federal government during the New Deal as precedent to enable cooperative federalism which is \u201can intermingling of power, policy, and resources among the national and state governments\u201d. The \u201cgovernment established programs providing federal funding in areas that were traditionally the exclusive domains of the state, such as health, transportation, education, employment, and poverty relief\u201d.

Many hikes are considered dangerous due to their steep pitches and exposure to the elements, while others can be considered dangerous due to less activity and poor trail blazing, such as bushwhacks. Other factors such as inclement weather can dramatically increase the danger of even a moderate hike. Proper preparedness, familiarity of the trails, understanding of incoming weather patterns and communicating your plans and timing to another person helps reduce risk in hiking the White Mountains, but one always assumes some degree of risk. A simple sprained ankle can mean life or death in bad weather, as the White Mountains, and notably the Presidential Range and Mount Washington, are notorious for life-threatening weather. Combined with very exposed routes and lack of safety equipment, even the most experienced hikers have fallen victim to the White Mountains. For experienced hikers seeking more adventurous routes, one might refer to the popular list \"The  Terrifying 25\" which provides a list of routes that have steep inclines, a lot of exposure, fun ladders and caves, among other features. Huntington Ravine on Mount Washington is considered the most dangerous in all the Whites for its erratic weather, steep, exposed trails with drop-offs, and less traveled by other hikers."

        "input": "",
        "output": "There are many elements to a good cocktail, and these can often be modified to fit individual tastes. In general, a cocktail contains a base spirit, flavors from bitters or amaros, and something to sweeten. There are optional ingredients to add as well, like fruit, juice, or herbs. \n\nThe amount of each ingredient can vary the flavor significantly, so it is important to understand the impact of each ingredient. For example, very strong flavors like bitters or absinthe should be used in very small quantities. Sometimes even a rinse in the cocktail glass or spritz on the top of the prepared cocktail is enough to add the desired amount of flavor.\n\nA good cocktail comes about from a balance in flavors that build and develop off one another. The deep wooden flavor in whiskey is brightened by the citrus twist of an old fashioned. The sweetness from pineapple juice is deepened by the bitterness of campari in a jungle bird. The bitterness of ginger syrup is balanced with the tartness of lemon juice in a penicillin. \n\nMany newer cocktails are spins off a classic. Each builds off a flavor profile and modifies some of the more subtle flavors therein. If one wants to experiment with creating a new cocktail, starting with a classic favorite could be a good place to start. \n\nIt is also possible to create the same balanced flavors without the use of spirits (or with the use of alcohol free spirits)."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Carnitine is a quaternary ammonium compound involved in metabolism in most mammals, plants, and some bacteria. In support of energy metabolism, carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria to be oxidized for free energy production, and also participates in removing products of metabolism from cells. Given its key metabolic roles, carnitine is concentrated in tissues like skeletal and cardiac muscle that metabolize fatty acids as an energy source. Generally individuals, including strict vegetarians, synthesize enough L-carnitine in vivo.\n\nCarnitine exists as one of two stereoisomers (the two enantiomers d-carnitine (S-(+)-) and l-carnitine (R-(\u2212)-)). Both are biologically active, but only l-carnitine naturally occurs in animals, and d-carnitine is toxic as it inhibits the activity of the l-form. At room temperature, pure carnitine is a whiteish powder, and a water-soluble zwitterion with relatively low toxicity. Derived from amino acids, carnitine was first extracted from meat extracts in 1905, leading to its name from Latin, \"caro/carnis\" or flesh.\n\nSome individuals with genetic or medical disorders (such as preterm infants) cannot make enough carnitine, requiring dietary supplementation. Despite common carnitine supplement consumption among athletes for improved exercise performance or recovery, there is insufficient high-quality clinical evidence to indicate it provides any benefit."

        "output": "As a first attempt to answer the question of why human beings\u00a0have a tendency to think they are always\u00a0right, we could point to cognitive biases, and in particular to one called \"confirmation bias\". This bias conditions human beings to use any new evidence to confirm their pre-existing beliefs,\u00a0and to reject any new\u00a0evidence that contradicts these beliefs. People may also experience the so-called illusory superiority, another bias that conditions them to overestimate their skills and make them believe they are superior to the rest. However these biases, as concrete as well-proven as they are, are only part of the explanation. The book\u00a0\"Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error\" by\u00a0Kathryn Schulz is an exploration on why humans have the tendency to disregard errors and think they are always right. Shulz describes how people start with the assumption that they are right in everything they believe, and when they realise they have made a mistake, instead of challenging this assumption, they actually feel relief\u00a0and think: \"I was right except for this particular error I was making, but now that I have realised it I can certainly say that I am 100% right in everything\"."

But there are a couple things you can do to dress it up a bit - think about your school days and sliding that english paper into a fresh new folder with a carefully penned title on the front. So back to wood carving.  What can you do?  Let's say you've carved yourself a nice salmon complete with fens and gill lines.  Well here are three ways to dress it up.  First and most obvious  - paint it.  You can go for detail paint or you can use more of a water color approach that will give the wood a colored wash.  The sky is really the limit here.  Second, you mount it on a stand so it floats about the ground.  Drill a small whole in the bottom of the fish, do the same in a wood block you've sanded up and you have s stand.  Third and a bit more out there - consider if there are simple additions you can add.  I made an angler fish and used a drive flower with stem as the attached antenna.  Look around and think about what you can add to your project.  Last and most basic, put a coat of varnish on it to seal it up - and if you choose give it a bit of shine.  All these ideas will give a little bit of extra finish and pop to your project."

Royal Navy submarines operating off the coast of Argentina could use electronic sensors in their periscopes to detect electronic signals from Argentine aircraft as they took off. These subs provided the fleet with enough advanced warning to launch Sea Harriers on interception missions. Consequently, an Argentine pilot needed to be ready to dogfight a Harrier, dodge surface-to-air missiles, and then pull off a low-level bombing run.

Meditate daily: When you start meditation, it seems useless. But overtime, you start feeling the benefits. For some people it takes days, for some months. But just learn to sit in peace with yourself.\n2. Find a therapist you feel comfortable with: I went through 3-4 therapists and therapy styles till I found the right one. And I wouldn't want it any other way. I used to think therapy is useless, but now I swear by it.\n3. Set time aside in the day to stress: For example, I used to set aside 8 PM to stress. When I would feel anxious about something I could not control, I would just tell myself that I will think about it at 8 PM. It takes practice but it helps.\n4. Go outdoors or find a hobby group: As much as I love my bed and TV, just getting myself out there between people helped me so much. I would recommend it for everyone. Being in introvert, I used to hate being around new people. Now I just put myself out there and I know people almost everywhere I go for my hobbies.\n5. It's ok to take medication. If anxiety and depression are spoiling your quality of life, it's ok to speak to a psychiatrist and see if they can recommend any medication. It almost was taboo growing up for me, but now I see the benefits.\n6. Talk your partners / close friends and express your feelings. Take support from people around you. If they know you are struggling, they will be sensitive enough to help you out.\nHope this helps."

They learned that no matter what, mama would always be around to clean up their mess \u2014 literally and figuratively. Their moms did their laundry well into their twenties. They don't know how to do basic things around the house like boil an egg, cook rice or pick up after themselves. A telltale sign of a mama's boy: he comes home with a new purchase, opens it up, leaves all the plastic packaging lying around on the kitchen table. It doesn't bother him. He literally does not see the trash he leaves around. Mama's boys don't know how to pay their bills, manage their checking accounts, do grocery shopping and many, many more things. But these behaviors are symbolic of a much deeper deficiency: their emotional intelligence is practically nonexistent. Typically, it takes decades to train a mama's boy to be a fully functioning adult who can be an acceptable partner. It's possible only if he's willing to admit his faults and try every day to be a better human being."

        "output": "Woodworking benches come down to personal preferences, such as height, but they are some fundamental properties that people agree on. Some that most agree on are flatness, sturdiness (so that the bench does not move around) and the presence of vises (to allow clamping pieces). Most workbenches in woodworking history gravitate around arranging these 3 core elements in different configuration. One French example is the Roubo, which is hefty, and has two vises for front and tail clamping.\nUltimately, it comes down to preference and workflow."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Braising is a common cooking technique where some primary ingredient (typically a cut of tough meat) cooks for a long time under low temperature and with lots of liquid. The main advantage of braising is that it causes the collagen in the meat fibers to break down into gelatin, which makes the meat fibers more separated and thus the meat more tender. In addition, the gelatin mixes with the remaining cooking liquids to create a scrumptious sauce. Thus, the overall process transforms meat from tough into tender, along with a tasty sauce that can be served alongside the meat. Braising is also convenient in that the cook does not have to attend frequently to the food during the cooking process. These two reasons, namely, rendering  tough cuts of meat (which also tend to be cheaper) more tender and requiring less effort from the cook, have made braising a common cooking technique among several cultures."

American football, also known as gridiron, was first played in 1869 in the United States and mostly known in the United States and Canada. It rivals two teams on a rectangular field. Both teams have an offence as well as a defence formation. The first offence and defence of the match is decided by coin tossed where the winner decide for the first half of the match while the opposite match starts at the half-time mark. The offence team tries to take the oval-shaped ball to the other side of the field by passing or running it at each play. The defence team blocks the offence team so they get the balls themselves either by steeling it or when the offence team hasn\u2019t progressed 10 yards in 4 plays. Then, offence team becomes defence and vice versa. When the offence team successfully reach the 10-yard lines, they obtain a new set of 4 plays to get to the endzone, where they obtain points when succeeding, called a touchdown. They also get points from kicking the ball within the goalpost. The winning team is the one with the most points at the end of the game. European football, also known as soccer, is a match between two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field, known as pitch. Players primarily use their feet to propel a sphere-shaped ball across the field into the rectangular shaped goal guarded by a goalkeeper. The goalkeeper is the only player of each team that can use his hands and arms on the ball within a specific region of the field close to their goals. The game is played continuously until a fault is committed or the ball exits the field. Each team tried and kick the ball in the goal to get points and the winner is the team with the most point at the end of the match."

More than just writing detection rules, detection engineering is a process\u2014applying systems thinking and engineering to more accurately detect threats. The goal is to create an automated system of threat detection which is customizable, flexible, repeatable, and produces high quality alerts for security teams to act upon. Detection engineering is not yet a mature discipline with consistent methods and predictable results, but pioneers in the field are working towards this goal. There is not a lot written about the concept right now, no go-to standards or frameworks. It appears companies are developing their own approaches to incorporate the concept to improve their detection and response capabilities. \n\nA concept called detection-as-code (DaC), first coined by Anton Chuvakin in 2020, is at the heart of detection engineering, and points to the idea that detections should be treated as code. Essentially, it is about applying software engineering best practices to detections using modern agile CI/CD processes. \n\nThe benefits Of Detection Engineering include 1) reduced mean-time-to-response through automation of detections, 2) detections are more relevant to the environment, 3) the process is structured, repeatable, and informs workflows, 4) detection rules and analytics are version controlled, reused, and modified as needed, 5) Peer review and automated testing are part of the process, to catch mistakes and gaps."

        "output": "context switching, which occurs when a process is paused by the cpu and another process starts running can affect performance of a computer systems for a couple of reasons. The act of switching the context is not in itself very time consuming. The real performance hit comes from the fact that different processes have different virtual memory address spaces so all the caches in the system need to be invalidated and flushed. Since there is such a huge difference in how fast a cpu can run compared to how fast instructions and data can be retrieved from main memory, these things are cached close to the cpu in onboard caches. Even a pointer to a mapping of virtual addresses to physical addresses are cached so that memory access is faster. When a new process gets loaded by the cpu with a different address space and mapping of virtual to physical addresses, all of the data in the caches is invalid and needs to be flushed. This leaves the cpu with empty caches that have to be rebuilt from scratch for the new process, meaning there will be a big slowdown in retrieving instructions and data since these will now be coming from main memory, which is much slower than the cpu's cache."

They say it takes a village to raise a child, but raising that child starts with being a good mother.  While they are doing all of this for their own child(ren) they are also taking care of themselves, their household, their spouse and in a lot of cases their own career.  In order to manage all of these things, you must be good at multi-tasking and juggling a lot of responsibilities at the same time.  This is why I believe mothers are good at multi-tasking."

One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. \"How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \n\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation. She looked at the sculptor and then nodded her assent. \"We decree that you shall build these statues in a hall set aside, into which no one shall enter until your work is complete and you proclaim that to us after opening the doors of the hall from within.\"",

Therefore, it is recommended that applicants apply between 30-60 days before they plan to enter Uzbekistan. If the applicant plans to visit Uzbekistan starting June 1, they should apply for the e-visa no later than May 1.\n\nUzbekistan e-visa windows are 90 days, but are only valid 30 days once the applicant enters Uzbekistan.

The e-visa issued would be valid between April 15 \u2013 June 15. \n\nOnce the application is submitted, the applicant will receive an email to submit payment for the visa. Uzbekistan e-visas are nonrefundable.

Afterward, the applicant will receive a link to download the pdf of their e-visa to Uzbekistan. The applicant should verify for accuracy and ensure that the e-visa dates are valid during their dates of travel."

Then, place the slip knot on your dominant hand\u2019s needle with the yarn tail closest to you (the tail is the length you measured out). Hold both strands of yarn with your non-dominant hand. Spread the two strands of yarn out with your thumb and forefinger, then bring the knitting needle in your right hand to the front of the tail of yarn draped over your thumb. Bring the needle back, up and through the loop toward your thumb loop, then push the needle back and under the forefinger loop, allowing the needle to catch the forefinger loop and allowing the thumb loop to fall off under the needle.

This minimum amount, commonly referred to as the commercial bank's reserve, is generally determined by the central bank on the basis of a specified proportion of deposit liabilities of the bank. This rate is commonly referred to as the reserve ratio. Though the definitions vary, the commercial bank's reserves normally consist of cash held by the bank and stored physically in the bank vault (vault cash), plus the amount of the bank's balance in that bank's account with the central bank. A bank is at liberty to hold in reserve sums above this minimum requirement, commonly referred to as excess reserves.\n\nThe reserve ratio is sometimes used by a country\u2019s monetary authority as a tool in monetary policy, to influence the country's money supply by limiting or expanding the amount of lending by the banks. Monetary authorities increase the reserve requirement only after careful consideration because an abrupt change may cause liquidity problems for banks with low excess reserves; they generally prefer to use open market operations (buying and selling government-issued bonds) to implement their monetary policy. In the United States and many other countries (except Brazil, China, India, Russia), reserve requirements are generally not altered frequently in implementing a country's monetary policy because of the short-term disruptive effect on financial markets."

        "input": "",
        "output": "CRISPR  (an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a family of DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea. These sequences are derived from DNA fragments of bacteriophages that had previously infected the prokaryote. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral (i.e. anti-phage) defense system of prokaryotes and provide a form of acquired immunity. CRISPR is found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea.\n\nCas9 (or \"CRISPR-associated protein 9\") is an enzyme that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and cleave specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence. Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that can be used to edit genes within organisms. This editing process has a wide variety of applications including basic biological research, development of biotechnological products, and treatment of diseases. The development of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 which was awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna.\n\nIn 2022, in a proceeding at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (interference 106,115), the Patent Trial and Appeal Board decided that the inventor for the US patent covering application of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells is Feng Zhang, a professor of the Broad Institute."

Anyone can call themselves a hindu and no one will balk at them. The qualities we admire in humans that we wish to pursue cannot be easily manifested. Thus an idol sometimes takes it's place. As an example the monkey god is known for courage. So anytime you need to stand up you pray to the monkey god. The elephant god is for good beginnings.

This is needed as DNA sequencing technology might not be able to 'read' whole genomes in one go, but rather reads small pieces of between 20 and 30,000 bases, depending on the technology used. Typically, the short fragments (reads) result from shotgun sequencing genomic DNA, or gene transcript (ESTs).\n\nThe problem of sequence assembly can be compared to taking many copies of a book, passing each of them through a shredder with a different cutter, and piecing the text of the book back together just by looking at the shredded pieces. Besides the obvious difficulty of this task, there are some extra practical issues: the original may have many repeated paragraphs, and some shreds may be modified during shredding to have typos. Excerpts from another book may also be added in, and some shreds may be completely unrecognizable."

We spend a lot of time with them before any seriously suspenseful or horrific things happen. We understand they're a tight crew, and care about each other, and that they already feel some animosity towards the mining company that sent them out into space. This makes it a lot more scary and sad when eventually most of them become prey to the alien.\n\nSecondly, the main villain in Alien is not only way scarier than almost any other creature villain ever made, the way they build up both her backstory and her eventual full reveal is amazing. When we first see the small chestburster alien, neither we nor the crew have any idea how big, terrifying, and lethal she will become. From her sticky, slick sheen to her cunning and silent hunting skills, she is truly an unstoppable force. If I were trapped on a spaceship with that creature, I don't know what I'd do.\n\nAnd finally, Alien just feels more \"real\" with its universal and timely themes of greed and fear of the unknown. There are numerous actual stories of mining companies betraying their field employees and endangering their lives for a quick buck; isolated teams of workers going crazy,  suffering from unseen maladies, and falling into chaos and disarray; and of course, the tale of predator and prey is perhaps the oldest one of all. Its visceral, brutal, claustrophobic terror felt imminently possibly in the 1970s when it was made, and has only increased with time."

Their lighting director, Chris Kuroda, is known as the fifth member of the band as the lighting meshes seamlessly with the music.  Phish has been together since 1983 and over the course of the past 40 years they have hundreds of original songs as well as incorporating their own take on many cover songs.  The lyrics range from whimsical to melancholic but are more often geared towards the whimsical side.

The process of steaming the milk modifies the proteins to create a thick foamy  consistency allowing baristas to create patterns on top of the milk from the brown of the coffee and white of the milk. This is often referred to as latte art.\n\nAlthough similar to a latte, the flat white has a stronger coffee flavour due the having a higher proportion of coffee to milk. The latte typically has a total volume of approximately 240ml compared to the 160ml in a flat white.  In addition, the foamy milk is thicker in a flat white giving it a \"flatter\" appearance.\n\nAlthough originating from the southern hemisphere, flat whites have gained global popularity and are now both a mainstay for specialist coffee shops as well as large  coffee shop chains such as Starbucks."

Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  \n\nThis mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.  The practical outworking of this is studios are encouraged to hire local talent and use local services when producing their film.  The ratios for these rebates is fairly complicated and have created a new industry of tax professionals serving the film industry.\n\nSo then why Georgia?

The number of green cards issued each year is fixed at 140000 and each country is capped with a 7% quota i.e. no more than 9800 green cards can be issued to residents of a single country. Since there are hundreds of thousands of people who come to work in the US from India and China every year, they have to wait several years before they become eligible for a green card. This long delay can disrupt the lives of these people since the work visa they have does not grant them permission to reside and work in the US on a permanent basis, and they may have to leave the US, along with their families, if their work visa expires."

I like that it's indoors so it can continue in the winter months and rain or shine. I like that they have a nap in the middle of the day so they can re-charge for the afternoon play session. While my dog doesn't got there for more than 9 hours, it is convenient that the daycare is open from 7am to 7pm in case I needed him to stay there longer. I like that they have two separate playrooms at our daycare, one for smaller breeds/older dogs/timid dogs, and the other for larger dogs/younger dogs who may want to roughhouse more. Another great benefit is that my daycare offers spa services for my dog like a bath, nail trimming, ear cleaning, teeth brushing, and I do take advantage of that every other month or so. Last, if we are going out of town, and my son can't come over to watch our dog, the dog daycare center does offer boarding services. I would highly recommend that you check it out!"

In 1994, an estimated 35,000\u201340,000 United States residents were medically deafblind. Helen Keller was a well-known example of a deafblind individual. To further her lifelong mission to help the deafblind community to expand its horizons and gain opportunities, the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults (also called the Helen Keller National Center or HKNC), with a residential training program in Sands Point, New York, was established in 1967 by an act of Congress.\n\nThe deafblind community has its own culture, comparable to those of the deaf community and the blind community. Members of the deafblind community have diverse backgrounds but are united by similar experiences and a shared, homogeneous understanding of what it means to be deafblind. Some deafblind individuals view their condition as a part of their identity."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Structural genomics seeks to describe the 3-dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. The principal difference between structural genomics and traditional structural prediction is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large number of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allows scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs.\n\nBecause protein structure is closely linked with protein function, the structural genomics has the potential to inform knowledge of protein function. In addition to elucidating protein functions, structural genomics can be used to identify novel protein folds and potential targets for drug discovery. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or structural homology to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure.\n\nAs opposed to traditional structural biology, the determination of a protein structure through a structural genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in structural bioinformatics, i.e. determining protein function from its 3D structure.\n\nStructural genomics emphasizes high throughput determination of protein structures. This is performed in dedicated centers of structural genomics.\n\nWhile most structural biologists pursue structures of individual proteins or protein groups, specialists in structural genomics pursue structures of proteins on a genome wide scale. This implies large-scale cloning, expression and purification. One main advantage of this approach is economy of scale. On the other hand, the scientific value of some resultant structures is at times questioned. A Science article from January 2006 analyzes the structural genomics field.\n\nOne advantage of structural genomics, such as the Protein Structure Initiative, is that the scientific community gets immediate access to new structures, as well as to reagents such as clones and protein. A disadvantage is that many of these structures are of proteins of unknown function and do not have corresponding publications. This requires new ways of communicating this structural information to the broader research community. The Bioinformatics core of the Joint center for structural genomics (JCSG) has recently developed a wiki-based approach namely Open protein structure annotation network (TOPSAN) for annotating protein structures emerging from high-throughput structural genomics centers."

In the opening lines of the Creation story in the book of Genesis, the foundational story for all Abrahamic cultures, we learn that all the world was darkness and void.  (Darkness came first.) And then God said \"Let there be light.\"  (Light came second.)  \"And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the first day.\" \n\nThis last sentence is critical. The first day consists of evening followed by morning. The Jewish calendar abides by this tradition.  Its days are not morning to morning. Its days are night to night (as marked by sundown).  \n\nAs an example, the Jewish sabbath (Shabbat) is on the 7th day of the week. Shabbat = Shevat in Hebrew, which literally translates to the number seven.  The seventh day of the  week is is Saturday. However, Shabbat doesn't span Saturday morning to Sunday morning.

        "input": "",
        "output": "You should start planning your Walt Disney World vacation at least six months in advance.  First figure out your travel arrangements.  If you are able to drive, you will have your own vehicle available to travel to the parks.  If you fly, you will either need a rental car or will need to use other forms of transportation, such as uber or lyft.  Within the Walt Disney World parks and resorts there is Disney provided transportation, but it is often crowded during peak hours such as park opening and closing.  Next you will need to decide where to stay.  The Walt Disney World resorts are the most convenient, but also the most expensive option.  There are Walt Disney World resorts cater to different economic levels from more affordable up to more luxurious.  Staying on the grounds will also often allow to enter parks earlier or stay later than the general public.  Staying off the grounds is usually less expensive.  There are many hotels and resorts in the Orlando area to choose from.  Other options are to use a rental service such as VRBO or AirBnB to rent a property such as a house or condo for your stay.  Next you need to decide on how many days in the parks you'll spend and whether you will stay in one park for an entire day or want to have the option to \"park hop\".  Tickets are discounted for a larger number of days in the park.  The \"park hopper\" option is a premium on top of the base ticket price.  Often there are discount ticket websites but be careful about scams.  The safest is to buy from Disney or a licensed travel advisor.  Typically the price from a travel advisor is they same as buying from Disney.  Next make a budget for how much you'll spend on food in the parks.  Food is fairly pricy, but there are options from counter service all the way up to sit down restaurants and fine dining.  Realize that eating in a sit down restaurant will take time away from other activities in the parks.  Reservations can be made on the Disney website but are often difficult to get for some restaurants.  Taking food into the park is also an option as there are lockers available at the parks to store things.  Some items such as knives are not allowed, so plan ahead if food needs to be sliced.  Next look at the rides and attractions that your family wants to ride and make a plan for which are the most important.  A guidebook such as the Unauthorized Guide to Disney World is very helpful to provide plans for your day(s) in the parks.  These guidebooks will give you help on when the lines for attractions will be shorter.  Don't just try to show up in a park without some sort of plan as to which attractions to visit and when.  Visiting without a plan will result in frustration, long waits, and disappointment.  Also realize that you will not be able to visit all of the park attractions in one visit.  As the time of your visit approaches watch the weather reports.  Late afternoon thunderstorms are typical in Orlando in the summertime.  Most attractions at Disney World are indoors and will continue operating during rain.  Rain ponchos can be purchased in the park, but they are more expensive in park than if you bring your own.  It can also be very hot during the summer, so plan on having water, sunscreen and wearing appropriate clothing for the weather.  Be aware of how your party's attitude is during your visit.  Visiting Disney World requires a lot of walking and also requires stamina.  If people are getting tired, take a break, either in the park or back at your hotel.  Don't make your visit a \"death march\".  Also base the length of your stay in the park on the age of people in your party.  Young children or elderly may require longer and more frequent breaks.  One option is to go to the park in the morning, go back to your hotel in the afternoon for a dip in the pool, and return to the park later afternoon or evening.  Pay attention to the park hours to know how early you can arrive and how late you can stay.  Most parks have some sort of parade and fireworks show at closing.  Most are very worthwhile to see.  And remember above all that you should have fun.  Don't be so focused on your plan of visiting attractions that you don't take advantage of spur of the moment opportunities such as interacting with characters or getting a quick photo with the family.  Hopefully this will not be your only vacation at Disney World, and you want to have fond memories of your visit so that you will want to return again as soon as possible."

An evident example of this phenomenon is a beauty standard for women and men. Society seems to agree on what features, both physical and internal, can deem a person beautiful. The standard of beauty is also projected beyond humans, onto animal breeds, for example, in cat shows. \nA link between beauty and how closely it resembles perfection appears to exist. For example, a rose with many petals and no tears or scratches is generally seen as more beautiful than one with fewer, visibly ruined petals. \nHowever, the question of perfection also raises a problem as it is difficult and arguably impossible to define perfection. Beauty does not necessarily mean perfection. For example, large eyes are statistically considered to be more attractive however, in terms of their biological  purpose they possess no superiority to small eyes. Therefore, both beauty and perfection depend on the perspective or purpose with which you observe an object.\n\nFurthermore, the clear fluctuations through centuries and cultures on what is considered to be beautiful should also be taken into account. Fashion trends and art styles, for instance,  are constantly changing. Additionally, the diversity in opinions suggests there is nothing that is considered beautiful by everyone, so even if the majority deem a particular object or thing as beautiful, it\u2019s beauty remains subjective because it remains based on an ever-changing preference rather than objective truth."

        "output": "Capitalism, an economic system that promotes the private generation and ownership of wealth and resources, helps promote innovations and economic growth. However, when left unchecked, it can also be a factor in economic inequality, as people are generally unequal in terms of ideas, drive/grit to push through, and access to capital resources. These provide some dis-proportional advantages of the economic wealth and resources to a few. In an ideal world, most players are expected to be considerate and mindful of equitability and balanced economic development. However, this is seldom the case, hence an approach for drawing a balance is by having government policies and laws, that protect the interest of the general citizenry and prevent bad players from taking advantage of the system. This is a very difficult problem, and a lot of countries are still struggling with this dilemma of striking a balance."

The results are presented as a mass spectrum, a plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures.\n\nA mass spectrum is a type of plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. These spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the chemical identity or structure of molecules and other chemical compounds.\n\nIn a typical MS procedure, a sample, which may be solid, liquid, or gaseous, is ionized, for example by bombarding it with a beam of electrons. This may cause some of the sample's molecules to break up into positively charged fragments or simply become positively charged without fragmenting. These ions (fragments) are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, for example by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection. The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles, such as an electron multiplier. Results are displayed as spectra of the signal intensity of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses (e.g. an entire molecule) to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Golf originated in Scotland in the 15th century. It is mostly regarded as an \"upper-class\" sport reserved for members of private country clubs, but has gained a lot of popularity over the last few decades. As a result, golf has become more broadly accessible to the general public, and today the sport is enjoyed by tens of millions of people around the world. \n\nIn golf, there are a total of eighteen stretches of grass, known as holes. Each hole is comprised of a tee box, where the golfer hits his or her initial shot, the fairway, and the green. Most holes also include deep grass that runs along the fairways, known as \"the rough\". For added difficulty, holes can also contain hazards like sand bunkers or bodies of water like ponds and creeks. A small circular hole is located on every green and is marked with a flag so that golfers can see it from far away. The objective is to get your golf ball from the tee box into that small hole in as few shots (known as \"strokes\") as possible. Golfers advance their ball by striking it with a golf club, and each ball strike is counted as a stroke. Golfers are allowed to use up to 14 golf clubs over the course of their round, each of which is used for different purposes, from different distances. Some clubs, like the driver, are used to hit the ball very long distances. In fact, most professional golfers are able to drive the ball over 300 yards. That's the length of three football fields! A combination of clubs called irons make up the majority of a set of golf clubs. They are are generally used to advance the ball to the green after the golfer hits his or her initial tee shot. The club face of each iron is designed with a different loft angle. Higher loft angles enable golfers to hit the ball higher in the air and shorter distances, whereas low loft angles produce lower trajectory shots that travel longer distances. The most frequently used club in the set is the putter, which is used to tap the ball from wherever it lies on the green into the hole. On average, most good golfers will putt the ball twice per hole, or approximately 36 times per round. \n\nGolf holes are designated as par 3, par 4, or par 5, depending on their length. These numbers are an indication of how many strokes it should take for a professional golfer to complete the hole. Par 3 holes are shorter, and should take a single stroke to get the ball from tee to green. Par 5 holes are longer, and should typically take three strokes to get from tee to green. Most golf courses have four par 3 holes, four par 5 holes, and ten par 4 holes, yielding an aggregate of par 72. At the end of a round of golf, players calculate their final score by aggregating their total number of strokes across all eighteen holes. Over time, the golfer's skill level is assessed by his or her \"handicap\", which is a system that reflects the average number of strokes over par that the player typically shoots. For example, if one's average round score is 79, their handicap is 7 because it's 7 strokes above par. The lower the handicap, the better the golfer."

The depth of colour and the level of tannin present in the resulting wine will be determined, largely, by the length of this maceration.

This is a huge advantage when it comes to providing services to global customers who are looking to use a team that is able to communicate in English.\n\nIndia is a developing country. The cost of living and the salary scale for employees is low compared the salary for similar employees in developed countries such as the United States of America, Great Britain, Australia, France, etc. The difference in salary levels provides a natural cost arbitrage that provides a compelling reason when a company is exploring to outsource.\n\nThe combination of the above factors namely availability of a trained workforce that is able to communicate in English and the arbitrage in salary costs makes India an attractive outsourcing partner for many businesses in the developed countries."

Hardwoods, on the other hand, are called \"hard\" because of much denser grains: compared to softwoods, hardwoods weigh more per volume due to this property. In other words, a board of walnut (a hardwood) weighs more than a board of the same size of pine (a softwood). They are more expensive because the trees take longer to grow and are typically more rare, but are used in fine wood-crafting arts like furniture making due to their robustness and beauty in the grain structure."

Seasons typically run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all other teams both home and away). Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.\n\nThe competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League founded in 1888; however, teams may still be relegated into and promoted from the EFL Championship. The Premier League takes advantage of a lucrative television rights sale to Sky: from 2019 to 2020, the league's accumulated television rights deals were worth around \u00a33.1 billion a year, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games respectively. The Premier League is a corporation where chief executive Richard Masters is responsible for its management, whilst the member clubs act as shareholders. Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of \u00a32.4 billion in 2016\u201317, with a further \u00a3343 million in solidarity payments to English Football League (EFL) clubs.\n\nThe Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. For the 2018\u201319 season, the average Premier League match attendance was at 38,181, second to the German Bundesliga's 43,500, while aggregated attendance across all matches is the highest of any association football league at 14,508,981. Most stadium occupancies are near capacity. The Premier League ranks first in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons as of 2021. The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of UEFA Champions League/European Cup titles, with five English clubs having won fourteen European trophies in total.\n\nFifty clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh clubs.

        "output": "The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States, and its remit is to provide the nation a more stable and durable monetary system. The Federal Reserve, or the Fed, is specifically tasked with maintaining maximum employment while ensuring price stability. The United States is currently experiencing persistent inflation. Typically, the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when initially trying to combat inflation. The increased rates make lending more expensive, and subsequently discourages capital investment and borrowing. The added cost in turn reduces demand for products and services. Lower demand normally leads to dropping prices to try and motivate potential buyers. The other primary method involves open-market operations. When inflation is running higher than expected, the Fed can reduce the money supply by selling securities and taking currency out of circulation. Since there are fewer dollars in circulation, each remaining dollar is correspondingly worth more than it was before those transactions."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Most importantly, a person should get married when they find the right person. But assuming one has found the right person, there are comparative advantages and disadvantages to marrying at a young age or an older age. Men have the advantage of not needing to worry about the 'biological clock' - unlike women, their reproductive age can extend into quite a late age, whereas women typically lose the ability to reproduce once they hit around the age of 40. An advantage of having children when one is young is that a man will have more energy and physical dexterity to be able to engage in physical activities with his children, like camping, biking, hiking, sports, skiing, etc. Bending over to change diapers will not be as painful on the back and knees. As a younger man, travel with children may be less discomforting. As an older man, one might have more time or flexibility of time to spend with one's children. An older man may also have greater financial resources to help make child raising easier. For example, an older man might have a larger house, or a greater ability to afford in-house child care. On the other hand, there are studies that show having an older father may increase the odds of a child having autism or attention deficit disorder. Anecdotally, it seems people who marry at a young age are more likely to divorce. But perhaps having two marriages, one when one is young and another when one is older, is not a bad thing. Men have the advantage of being able to sire two sets of children at different times in their lives, making this possible. But ultimately the decision should be based on whether or not you have met the person you know without a doubt you want to spend the rest of your life with. If you have found that person, you should stay with them."

He was born in a patrician family (senatorial class) called the Julii that claimed lineage from the Goddess Venus and the legendary Prince Aeneas of Troy. His birth in this family had already put him ahead of most others on the road to power.\n\nCaesar was smart, hard working and charming and made many friends and connections that would help him later in life. He married a relative of Gaius Marius, the dictator of Rome at the time and furthered his political connections. Though he suffered a setback when Sulla defeated Marius, Caesar was quickly able to use that to his advantage to escape a posting that required him to remain in Rome. It was important for any aspiring Consul (leader of Rome) to be seen as an effective military general who had conquered lands for Rome.\n\nCaesar's next significant position was that of Aedile where one of his primary duties were to organize games. Caesar borrowed heavily and organized lavish games so that the people of Rome would know him. Unlike other patricians, Caesar had grown up in the Subura where, at the time, the plebeians lived and knew the importance and power that could be garnered from the love of the people.\n\nThrough multiple appointments, Caesar displayed his military genius and was eventually elected Consul. He formed an alliance with two other leading figures of the time: Pompey (a decorated general) and Crassus (richest man in Rome) known now as the \"First Triumvirate\". \n\nAfter his consulship, Caesar become Governor of Gaul and eventually won a lot of territory for Rome. However, his political opponents in Rome readied a case for prosecuting him and stripping of power. Unwilling to be subject to that, Caesar gathered one of his legions and marched on Rome. His political opponents performed a tactical retreat from Rome leaving him in nominal control. He consolidated his power by winning multiple wars in Greece, Spain and Egypt eventually solidifying his hold on Rome and getting himself elected Dictator"

It's important that the free leg is twisted as far back and sideways as possible to add stability. \n\nYou'll then want to jump when your skating foot approaches your pick foot and complete a single rotation in the air. Bringing the arms together and having proper posture will help with completing the rotation. Then, you will want to land on your right leg on a backwards outside edge.

        "input": "",
        "output": "There were four strategies employed by the leaders of the modern civil rights movement.  The first was legalism, which used the courts to attack discriminatory laws or practices.  The limits of legalism are the cost, slow change, burden on the individual and it was elite driven.  The second was nonviolent direct action (NVDA).  NVDA identifies an unjust law which is then broken by individuals trying to promote change.  Individuals must then accept the consequences of breaking the law, but if enough do so, it puts pressure on local governments.  The third strategy was political action, which used voting on proactive agendas to force change.  Finally, the fourth strategy was the black power movement.  This strategy promoted disengagement from white-society and setting up a separate black power structure.  It provided services to the black community and promoted positive black images, but had weak leadership and was prone to violence and paranoia.\nIf I was advising a civil rights group today, I would advise them to use the first three strategies.  Legalism, NVDA and political action are positive and effective ways to enable change.  They usually encourage sympathetic news coverage and get the message of the group out to the broader public.  A strategy like the black power movement would not be effective.  If you want to change society, you can\u2019t separate from it or try to change it from the outside.  You need to work within the system to change it. Violence will also turn public support away from your group and allow government agencies to crack down on your leadership, making it hard to continue to bring about the change you desire."

This is apparent when there can be ambiguity between a list and an appositive. Take the following two example statements:\n\nWe went to dinner with our coaches, Chris and Terry.\nWe went to dinner with our coaches, Chris, and Terry.\n\nThe first statement can appear to imply that we went to dinner with two people whose names are Chris and Terry who are both our coaches. There is no such implication that can be extracted from the second statement. The second statement implies we went to dinner with at least 4 people: Chris, Terry, and at least two coaches. This type of ambiguity is what proponents of the Oxford comma latch onto in its defense.\n\nOn the other hand, opponents of the Oxford comma claim it should be avoided in favor of rewording sentences when necessary. The sentence:\n\nWe went to dinner with our coaches, Chris, and Terry.\n\nCan easily be reworded as:\n\nWe went to dinner with Chris and Terry, as well as our coaches.\n\nThe \"as well as\" language is claimed to be more clear than the Oxford comma albeit less concise.

        "input": "",
        "output": "For organizations to achieve the most value from their data, they must establish a data foundation that allows for high-quality reporting on past events. Establishing a Databrick\u2019s Lakehouse foundation requires no AI/ML capabilities. Then, over time, use that data AI/ML to drive automated decisions for crucial business processes.  For this reason, there is a direct correlation between the \u201cvalue curve\u201d for both data and intelligent automation. \nThe value maturity curve for intelligent automation starts with basic, attended, or unattended automation that mimics basic human processes today. Then, as you mature your Robotic Process Automation (RPA) program, your automation(s) need to expand to include simple document understanding AI.  Extracting data from the same form hundreds or thousands of times is a good example. Finally, for any organization to gain the highest value and ROI for their intelligent automation investments, using complex AI/ML to produce automated decisions for digital workers (unattended automation) enables exceptionally complex, long-running automation to be successfully developed, put into production, and maintained over time.\n\nIn summary, think of \u201cAI/ML\u201d as the thinking and \u201cIntelligent Automation\u201d as the doing. The value of both Data and RPA to any organization grows exponentially over time as they develop their ability to apply to complex AI/ML such that those models deliver trusted automated decisions to the digital workforce running complex automation."

Developing AI applications is a highly iterative process and generally strives in an agile environment.  However, organisations operate in a wide variety of contexts and come in many different shapes and sizes, hence it makes sense that there is no universal operating model for AI that fits everywhere. Regulatory requirements, data and resource availability and many other factors will play a role in determining the right operating model. \n\nIt is important then, to have a platform that is able to scale with the organisation as more use cases and users enter the pipeline, as more models are deployed and as more of the business is enhanced by data and AI. The services that underpin the operating model need to be flexible while at the same time ensuring that security and explainability permeate every step of the process."

These typically include both a live presenter and prepared slides for the audience to see, and usually, take away. Tools for creating these slide show, also referred to as \"decks,\" include Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides.

However, being slides, there is often little heed given to the principles of good writing. Directness, transitions, conciseness, clarity. \n\nA workshop or training event is another method of corporate communication. The key difference between this and other tools is that a workshop is usually for skill building of some type and incorporates (hopefully) a great deal of audience interaction (with the presenter and with other participants.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Compared to 10 years ago, this question has grown a lot harder to answer. In the old days, songs were indexed by song-writers. Prior to the digital age, the most popular media was physical cassettes, and it\u2019s natural to group the cassettes by artists. Moreover, artists used to be the primary mechanism to discover new music. The cost of listening to new songs was usually high, since there were few ways to try new music, so fans tended to buy music from the same artists for quality (and taste) assurance.\n\nWith the evolution of music streaming and the decline of the recording industry, the granularity of \u201clistening to music\u201d has refined significantly. Listeners no longer need to buy whole cassettes, but can pick songs individually. Moreover, recommendation algorithms allow fans to discover music by popularity, genre or even mood.  As a result, music fans now sample from such a wide range of artists that it\u2019s hard to name a single favorite. And due to the insane number of accessible songs, Even if you listen to a specific artist most frequently among your collection, you may still only like a small percentage of all the songs he/she wrote, which leads to the shaky conviction that you actually have a \u201cfavorite musician\u201d.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe the palette for music depends a lot on \u201cenvironment\u201d. It could be a physical environment (eg. beach or gym), an action (eg. working or cooking), or a mood (eg. chill or psyched). The like or dislike towards a certain piece of music changes drastically when these variables change. To some extent, I view music more as a tool than as an art form, in that I seek certain utility from music at different times. However, music judgment for me is also not 100% a rational or utilitarian process. It still very much comes from intuition, though that intuition is heavily biased by environmental factors."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The best way to lose weight is to be in a calorie deficit. This means that you are consuming less calories than you expend. An easy way to confirm this deficit is to track your calorie intake with a calorie tracking application like MyFitnessPal. This helps you better understand the macronutrient composition (protein, carbohydrates, fat) of your food, and which foods are more calorically dense than others. One gram of protein has 4 calories per gram, one gram of carbohydrate has 4 calories per gram, and one gram of fat has 9 calories per gram. Each food that you consume is either one or a combination of these three macronutrients. It is possible to expend calories to create a larger deficit through exercise. There are many types of exercise, but most types can be categorized as either cardiovascular training or weight training. Both types of exercise are important, as cardiovascular exercises, such as walking, running, and biking, train your heart and burn calories during exercise. Weight-based training involves challenging your muscles with loads in order to make them stronger to handle larger loads and more volume. Weight-based training does not burn as many calories during exercise, however this type of training taxes your muscles so that they need to repair and thus burns more calories throughout the day after your training session. Weight-based training is important for strong muscles, bones, and tendons. The best way to lose weight involves a combination of a calorie-controlled diet, cardiovascular exercise, and weight-based training exercise sustained over a duration of time until you meet your weight goal. Once you meet your goal, it is then important to sustain these good habits and not revert back to the habits and behaviors you were previously engaged in that contributed to your weight gain."

After kicking it is important to keep the streamlined position for some time to maintain the speed through gliding. The exact duration of gliding depends on the target distance of a given event or race. The longer the distance of the race is, the longer the gliding phase should be.

However, neither where coffee was first cultivated nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have been found. Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee. By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass productization of coffee has made it a household item today."

The word \"Bohra\" in Gujarati means \"to trade\" hence most of them prefers to do businesses & are quite involved in Software, Iron or Metal trading majorly.\n\nFrom a religious perspective, They usually follow seven pillars of Islam (Walayah, Taharah, Salat, Zakah, Sawm, Hajj & Jihad) instead of Five. They're also quite active in Muharram-al-Haram performing the Mourning of Husayn ibn Ali & Ahl-al-Bayt and the day of the Ashura. They have an annual event of \"Ashara Mubaraka\" where they gather from across the world at a chosen place to perform the Mourning & doing community services. They're also very active in Ramadan & other months to celebrate Eid-al-Fitr, Eid-al-Adha, Eid-al-Ghadir etc. \n\nAt present their current leader & Dai-al-Mutlaq is His Holiness Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin who resides in Saifee Mahal, Mumbai, India. To know more about this community, I would suggest to read \"Mullahs on the Mainframe: Islam and Modernity among the Daudi Bohras\" by Jonah Blank published first in 2001."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The difference between lead climbing and top rope climbing has to do with the location of the rope when the climb is started. In lead climbing the rope begins at the bottom attached to the climber as well as the belayer. The climber must then bring the rope from the bottom of the route to the top by clipping into a series of quick draws that are generally placed 10-15 feet apart. If a person were to fall while lead climbing, they would be caught by the last quick draw they clipped into. When top rope climbing, the rope is already at the top of the route. This means the climber must tie into one side of the rope while their belayer must clip into the other side of the rope. As the climber ascends higher up the route the belayer must take out the slack of the rope as opposed to lead climbing where the belayer would be giving slack. When a person falls in top rope climbing they will only fall a short distance as the rope is already clipped in above them at the top of the route, so how far they fall will be determined by how much slack the belayer has not taken in."

The syndrome is no longer recognized as a diagnosis, having been merged with other conditions into autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It was considered to differ from other diagnoses that were incorporated into ASD by relatively unimpaired spoken language and intelligence.\n\nThe syndrome was named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who, in 1944, described children in his care who struggled to form friendships, did not understand others\u2019 gestures or feelings, engaged in one-sided conversations about their favorite interests, and were clumsy. In 1994, the diagnosis of Asperger's was included in the fourth edition (DSM-IV) of the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; however, with the publication of DSM-5 in 2013, the syndrome was removed, and the symptoms are now included within autism spectrum disorder along with classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It was similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of 2021.\n\nThe exact cause of Asperger's is poorly understood. While it has high heritability, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition. There is no single treatment, and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) guidelines suggest that \u2019treatment\u2019 of any form of autism should not be a goal since autism is not an 'a disease that can be removed or cured\u2019. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, while co-occurring conditions might require treatment, \u2019management of autism itself is chiefly about providing the education, training and social support/care required to improve the person's ability to function in the everyday world\u2019. Only limited data support the effectiveness of particular interventions for autism. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety. Autistic characteristics tend to become less evident in adulthood , but social and communication difficulties usually persist."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Cold calling is more art than science. The primary mistake people make when cold calling is in defining what success looks like.  For most sales roles, the goal of a cold call is to establish rapport, not to book an order.  Think about it - when was the last time you purchased something by phone the first time you were contacted?  Odds are that several follow ups were required before you were ready to buy, no matter how qualified a buyer you appeared to be.  \n\nEstablishing rapport means getting your prospect to open up, because he/she has determined that you are worth the time to do so.  So the keys to establishing rapport are simple:  be courteous and respectful, provide appropriate context, and be OPEN.   Let's consider each of these individually.  First, courtesy and respect- after briefly introducing yourself, ask the prospect if now is a good time to talk for a few minutes?  We've all experienced the annoyance of a caller who dives right into the conversation immediately after hearing a \"hello\".  Be respectful of your prospect's schedule and give him/her an \"out.\"  If it's not a good time, you're not going to have a successful call no matter what you try.  \n\nNext, provide appropriate context.  Don't assume he/she knows nothing about what you are trying to sell. If that were the case, this prospect wouldn't be a very good target for you! Prepare a short introductory statement that can be delivered in a genuine way with a friendly tone.  For example, \"I'm with ACME Mobile Window Repair and wanted to share some spring promotions with you - have you seen our trucks around your neighborhood?\"  Setting context will help build rapport by providing a clear understanding of why you are calling, and what you hope to get out of the conversation.  Successful sales people are very comfortable with the fact that they are trying to sell something.  Own it, but do so in a low key and friendly way, and this will help lower the defenses of your prospect if he/she sounds guarded\n\nLastly, be open.  This means open to going off script, open to hearing about competition or open to negative impressions of what you're selling.  An open dialogue allows room for questions, both from you and from your prospect.     Think about an enjoyable conversation you've had lately.  Was it a natural back and forth, with questions posed and answers provided?  Did the questions take the conversation into a deeper dialogue?  A successful cold call is one that feels like a natural conversation about a topic of shared interest. If your prospect goes off on a tangent, don't redirect too soon, or better yet - ask a question - \"I'm curious - What made you think of carpets when I mentioned windows?\"  If he/she goes negative about your offering, ask another question  - \"What in your experience has caused you to feel this way?\"  \n\nCold calling is a skill that can improve with practice.  The more comfortable you are being courteous, setting context, and remaining open, the better your sales outcomes will be.   And it never hurts to smile - even over the phone!"

The Tempest and A Midsummer Night's Dream are considered to be amongst his best comedies; whilst tragedies were arguably Shakespeare's greatest genre - Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, Julius Caesar and King Lear are all amongst his finest contributions to this field. Of these, Romeo and Juliet is often considered to be the greatest love story ever written, and Hamlet is widely regarded as one of the most important analyses of the human condition. William Shakespeare's plays are widely believed to be amongst the greatest ever written, and to this day are regularly performed around the world."

European Football is typically played on a grass turf surface called a pitch. European Football was actually first called soccer before its adoption by the entire world and ended up settling on the name football. This is where the common confusion surrounds European Football and American Football. American Football, created much later than European Football, is played with a pig skin with a prolate shape on a grass turf surface, much like European Football. In American Football, instead of using their feet, players use their hands to pass the ball to one another through the air or hand the ball off to one another and attempt to run into the opponent's endzone. When European Football eventually came to the United States, the moniker soccer remained with the sport. This is why European Football is the same as American Soccer and American Football is not the same as European Football."

Typically the buyer has nearly unlimited use of the software in perpetuity.  If updates to the software are required, a separate software maintenance package may be purchased.\n\nSubscription software allows unlimited use of the software for a predetermined period, often 1 year or 3 years, for a price.  Updates to the software are often included in the price of the subscription.  At the end of the subscription term, the buyer usually has the option to renew their subscription.\n\nConsumption-based software allows the buyer to pay for their actual usage of the software during a period of time, for example monthly.  In this type of arrangement, the actual usage can vary from period to period, resulting in customer charges that vary as well.  Some customers like knowing that they will only pay for what they use, while other customers dislike the unpredictability of their bills."

        "input": "",
        "output": "There are many great trees homeowners in growing region 6 may want to consider for their backyard depending on their priorities. \n\nFirst, the two main types of trees are deciduous, trees that lose their leaves each winter, and evergreen, which retain their foliage year round. Many of the most popular shade trees are deciduous trees, however there are some great evergreen options as well.\n\nStarting with deciduous trees, there are flowering trees and traditional shade trees. Of the traditional shade trees, you may want to consider maples and oaks, of which there are many varieties. Red maples grow a bit slower than silver maples, but have hardier bark, beautiful red leaves in the fall, and a more pleasing traditional branching habit that many prefer vs, Silver maples. Sugar maples growth slower still, but are beautiful, prized trees that turn glowing orange in the fall and produce the sap used in maple syrup come spring. These trees can be 40-70 feet tall at maturity. Oaks are incredibly beautiful trees that are typically a little slower growing than maples, but have strong bark, enabling them to survive harsher conditions and have a long lifespan. They can handle being used as street trees as they do fine with moderate pollution levels and salt from de-icing. You really can't go wrong with maples or oaks as a summer shade tree, with their tall canopies providing wonderful shade once their leaves fill in during the spring.\n\nSome popular flowering options that provide ample shade include cherry and magnolia trees, both of which have beautiful showy spring flowers and reach a height of 20-60 feet at maturity depending on which of the many variants you choose (be careful with this as some are best suited to warmer climates and don't tolerate the cold as well). \n\nFor evergreens, the options are a bit more limited as many of these trees have low canopies that extend all the way to the ground. Many species of spruce and fir tree can have their canopies raised as they mature, creating space underneath for shade. Some pine trees have ample canopy under them, however their thin needle density can limit the amount of shade they provide.\n\nWhichever you ultimately choose, Shade trees add a ton of value to a home and are a great investment. Consider working with an arborist to make the decision based on your lighting and soil conditions. Enlisting a professional's help with planting will ensure your new tree is set up to grow healthy and strong."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Singlish (a portmanteau of Singapore and English) (officially similar and related to Singaporean English) is an English-based creole language spoken in Singapore. Singlish arose out of a situation of prolonged language contact between speakers of many different languages in Singapore, including Hokkien, Malay, Teochew, Cantonese and Tamil.\n\nSinglish originated with the arrival of the British and the establishment of English-medium education in Singapore. Elements of English quickly filtered out of schools and onto the streets, resulting in the development of a pidgin language spoken by non-native speakers as a lingua franca used for communication between speakers of the many different languages used in Singapore. Singlish evolved mainly among the working classes who learned elements of English without formal schooling, mixing in elements of their native languages. After some time, this new pidgin language, now combined with substantial influences from Indian English, Peranakan, southern varieties of Chinese, Malay, and Tamil, became the primary language of the streets. As Singlish grew in popularity, children began to acquire Singlish as their native language, a process known as creolization. Through this process of creolization, Singlish became a fully-formed, stabilized and independent creole language, acquiring a more robust vocabulary and more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding.\n\nSinglish shares many linguistic similarities with Manglish or Bazaar Malay of Malaysia, although a few distinctions can be made, particularly in vocabulary. Manglish generally receives more Malay influence and Singlish more Chinese (Mandarin, Hokkien, etc.) influence. Initially, Singlish and Manglish were essentially the same dialect evolving from the British Malaya economy, born in the trading ports of Singapore, Malacca and Penang when Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia were for many purposes a de facto (from 1963 to 1965, de jure) single entity. Ever since the two countries separated, a divergence has been observed.\n\nLike all languages, Singlish and other creole languages show consistent internal logic and grammatical complexity. Due to its origins, Singlish shares many similarities with other English-based creole languages. As with many other creole languages, it is sometimes incorrectly perceived to be a \"broken\" form of the lexifier language - in this case, English. The uniqueness of Singlish has been studied by linguistics experts beyond Singapore."

Aerosols are tiny airborne particles typically from natural sources such as dust from soil or volcanic ash, sea salt, etc or artificial sources such as carbon from fossil fuels. These aerosols are light enough to be airborne for long periods of time or only a few hours. These serve as condensation nuclei for evaporated water that rises and cools. These aerosols act as a magnet for the vapor and allow it to condense around it and thus form water droplets. A large amount of these water droplets is what makes up a cloud."

When you understand the story and history behind a piece of music, it becomes more than just a series of notes and melodies; it becomes a powerful expression of emotion and meaning. Also knowing the background of the music can help us appreciate and connect with the music on a deeper level, allowing us to use it as a powerful tool for stress relief and relaxation.

In contrast, fly fishing the lures are typically called flies and are very light.  Because they are so light, a heavier line is used and the weight of the line is what allows the fly to be cast out and delivered to the water.  Spin fishing lures are often measured in ounces of weight and are often made of metal or plastic.  They can range in size and design depending on the target species of fish.  Fly fishing flies are typically very lightweight hairs, threads, or other materials tied to a hook.  The fly fishing line weights are measured in grains."

The term covers the organism's morphology (physical form and structure), its developmental processes, its biochemical and physiological properties, its behavior, and the products of behavior. An organism's phenotype results from two basic factors: the expression of an organism's genetic code (its genotype) and the influence of environmental factors. Both factors may interact, further affecting the phenotype. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called polymorphic. A well-documented example of polymorphism is Labrador Retriever coloring; while the coat color depends on many genes, it is clearly seen in the environment as yellow, black, and brown. Richard Dawkins in 1978 and then again in his 1982 book The Extended Phenotype suggested that one can regard bird nests and other built structures such as caddisfly larva cases and beaver dams as \"extended phenotypes\".\n\nWilhelm Johannsen proposed the genotype\u2013phenotype distinction in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism's hereditary material and what that hereditary material produces. The distinction resembles that proposed by August Weismann (1834\u20131914), who distinguished between germ plasm (heredity) and somatic cells (the body). More recently, in The Selfish Gene (1976), Dawkins distinguished these concepts as replicators and vehicles.\n\nThe genotype\u2013phenotype distinction should not be confused with Francis Crick's central dogma of molecular biology, a statement about the directionality of molecular sequential information flowing from DNA to protein, and not the reverse."

        "output": "Tortoises eat a range of fruit and vegetables although the mainstay of a tortoise\u2019s diet should be green leafy vegetables such as dandelions, clover, lettuce, vetch and kale. Your tortoise will enjoy sweet fruits such as bananas, strawberries, peaches and apples but these should be given no more than twice a week as the sugar can interfere with their digestive system. They can also become addicted to sweet fruits and you will find they might refuse to eat their healthy greens in favour of something sweet. \n\nTortoises should eat a daily portion of food that is equivalent to their shell size. Ideally, they should also have 1 - 2 days a week when they don\u2019t eat. This is because they have slow digestive systems and need a clear day or two for their systems to catch up. \n\nYou should give your tortoise a weekly supplement of calcium and D3. Use one specifically formulated for reptiles and simply sprinkle it onto a favourite food. Finally, always ensure your tortoise has access to fresh water by providing them with a bowl that they can climb into. They will drink by dipping their head under the water."

A few days later, John is accosted at a gas station outside of New York City by a group of Russian gangsters, led by Iosef, who fail to intimidate John into selling them his 1969 Boss 429 Mustang. That night, the men break into John's home and kill the puppy before stealing the car. Iosef takes the Mustang to a chop shop to remove its identifying details, but the shop owner, Aurelio, recognizes the vehicle and refuses service. John learns from Aurelio that Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov, the boss of the city's Russian mafia.\n\nLearning of his son's actions, Viggo beats and berates Iosef for incurring John's wrath. Viggo reveals that John was formerly a hitman in his employ, renowned and feared in the criminal underworld as the \"Baba Yaga,\" a ruthless and relentless \"man of focus, commitment, and sheer will.\" After John fell in love with Helen, a civilian, Viggo gave him a seemingly \"impossible task\" to earn his freedom.\n\nJohn recovers his concealed stash from his former career, including weapons and gold coins used as underworld currency for special services. He refuses Viggo's attempt to make amends for his son's actions and kills the hit squad subsequently sent to his home. As a result, Viggo puts a $2 million bounty on John's head, and his former mentor Marcus is enlisted to take him out. John lodges in the city at the Continental, a luxurious hotel that serves as neutral ground for the underworld and where conducting criminal \"business\" is strictly forbidden. The hotel's owner and John's old friend, Winston, secretly informs John that Iosef is at the Red Circle nightclub. John infiltrates the club and confronts Iosef, but he is attacked by Kirill, Viggo's henchman, and forced to retreat to the Continental for medical attention.\n\nAs John rests, he is targeted by a hitwoman named Ms. Perkins, who sneaks into his room. Marcus sees Perkins from an adjacent building and fires a warning shot to alert John. He wakes up and subdues Perkins, who reveals that Viggo doubled the bounty for her to kill him in the hotel. She also discloses that Viggo has a high-value stash concealed in a church. John has another hitman, Harry, secure Perkins, but she escapes and kills Harry.\n\nAt the church, John destroys Viggo's cache of cash and extensive blackmail material. When Viggo arrives to assess the damage, John assaults him and his men but is captured after being hit by Kirill's car. John tells Viggo that he will not stop until Iosef is dead because the puppy gave him hope and a chance to not be alone in his grief for Helen. Marcus intervenes again to save John, allowing him to kill Kirill and threaten Viggo into revealing his son's location. John assaults the safehouse and kills Iosef. Afterward, Marcus encourages John to return to the everyday life he has built, but their meeting is witnessed by Perkins, who reveals Marcus's duplicity to Viggo. He has Marcus tortured and killed before calling John to taunt him with the details, drawing him back to the city.\n\nPerkins is executed at Winston's behest for breaking the Continental's rules, and Winston informs John that Viggo is preparing to leave the city by helicopter. John races to the New York Harbor, where he fights and mortally wounds Viggo. Resigned to dying from his own injuries, John watches a video on his phone of Helen telling him they need to go home. He breaks into a nearby animal clinic, treats his wounds, and adopts a pitbull puppy scheduled to be euthanized before beginning the walk home."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The journey from cold prospect to loyal customer is as tricky as the alchemy that transforms a stranger into a close personal friend. While there are a thousand possible paths, a handful of methods have proven consistently effective as triggers for moving prospects down the funnel toward purchase.\n\nThe first is personal referral. A personal referral or endorsement is worth more than 10,000 words of marketing material. Knowing that someone we know and trust can vouch for a product or service counts for so much that we will instinctually lower our guard and open our ears to a sales pitch.\n\nSecond is the testimonial. Like a referral, knowing that someone else -- generally a brand we know or at least can recognize -- uses a product or service predisposes us to try it ourselves. This is especially true of unknown brands or products. Think of when you pass a new restaurant. You may not know the name, the menu or the quality but if there's a crowd inside we naturally assume it must be good. The same goes for a new brand -- when you see others are endorsing it, we relax our natural suspicion and are more willing to give it a try.\n\nThird is the offer. It's not enough to build a great product. You have to overcome people's natural reluctance to open their wallets when you're asking them to pay full price. The offer can take many forms -- from a discount to a free trial to a bonus offer. Adding urgency -- such as a limited quantity or expiration on the offer can also help.\n\nFourth is the three-step. This works especially well for big-ticket items or purchases that involve a large number of people or disruption to an organization. The 3-step acknowledges that nobody buys a $2,000,000 solution without giving it a lot of thought. So first we simply get them to raise their hand and express interest. This can be done through a top-of-funnel asset like an eBook or webinar. The second step is an offer that gets them more involved with the product, such as a demo. And the third step is a face-to-face meeting with the sales team.\n\nFifth is third-party validation. Many prospects have an allergic reaction to anything that smells like marketing. But what if they are reading a glowing piece about your. in the Wall Street Journal? Or Gartner places you at the top of one of its magic quadrants? This kind of validation from what is perceived as an objective source carries a lot more weight than marketing content. \n\nIn practice, most businesses use a combination of the five techniques described above. Each will resonate in different ways with prospects; and in combination they can be extremely effective at creating that aura around your company and products that cause the prospect to push the \"Buy now\" button."

        "instruction": "Monster Hunter 4 Unlimited (hereafter, \"MH4U\") was a video game released exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS circa 2013. Elden Ring was a video game released for multiple platforms in circa 2022 to critical acclaim. \n\nIf MH4U and Elden Ring were considered to be siblings nine years apart in a small family, how might the experiences of MH4U have influenced the growth and development of Elden Ring?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Young parents face many challenges. Finances, education, and home expenses often compete with the needs of a growing family. Within the context provided, MH4U reflects the first child of a young couple who must make several investments, including clothing, baby essentials, and furniture.  This may be conveyed under the limited system resources available to MH4U under the 3DS console: 128MB of RAM. Additionally, one or both parents may work full time, leaving limited time to work with and grow the child. As the child, MH4U,  enters age 9, they should be entering 4th or 5th grade and have developed the cognitive and functional skills to support their parents. Additionally, the parents will have likely developed further in their careers and caretaking abilities that ensure the stability and growth of a small family. In this example, Elden Ring represents the second child, which arrives nine years after MH4U. In this context, as a result of the growth of experience and income of the family, and assuming the family equates to a Playstation 4, the family now enjoys 8GB of RAM.\n\nAs described in the preceding paragraph, the familial environment that Elden Ring emerges from is vastly different than that of MH4U. However, there are additional benefits beyond the system limitations provided. These benefits are conveyed through the emotional and physical support provided through familial bonds, in this case, that of an older and younger sibling. Upon the arrival of Elden Ring, MH4U is eager to help their parents with caretaking tasks which may include keeping the child company, completing small jobs and errands, and establishing familial bonds with their sibling. The parents will be able to draw upon the experience of raising MH4U and apply those lessons to their newest member of the family. It\u2019s important that the parents continue to create small jobs for MH4U that help to convey positive responses to younger family members: caretaking, guidance, and companionship. \n\nAs MH4U graduates from their teens and enters early adulthood, it\u2019s critical that they stay actively involved in the life of their sibling. By age 18, MH4U will now be nine years older than Elden Ring, which as it happens, is the same age when MH4U became an older sibling. Under this lens, MH4U carries greater social responsibility than they did when they were the same age as Elden Ring. MH4U may also begin to contemplate leaving the family for continuing education. While it\u2019s common for individuals to depart the family for secondary education after age 18, it\u2019s critically important that MH4U continue to maintain constant contact with its younger sibling to provide guidance and advice and convey lessons learned from its formative experiences.  \n\nIn this way, Elden Ring has a fast track to develop. MH4U is able to provide guidance equatable to best practices, experiences, and trial and error. Additionally, MH4U development during constrained resources encourages Elden Ring to do \u201cmore with less\u201d and ensures a fastidious approach towards the allocation of resources. By the time Elden Ring approaches age 18, they enjoy the combined experiences of their parents and their older sibling which helps to increase their likelihood of success and families are stronger when they provide guidance and stability to their children.\n\nIn summary, the success of Elden Ring was no accident. The investments of the parents into the older sibling, MH4U, however lacking, provided a baseline level by which MH4U could invest in its younger sibling Elden Ring. Through this chain of investments, the family finds a greater chance of success. Under the lens of the original context, there would not be a critically reception to Elden Ring had not the parents made baseline investment and support to MH4U during the formative years of the family."

Although people think it is too expensive or inconvenient to get rid of plastics, we should reduce the amount of plastic used or increase the price of plastics.\u00a0One reason is that when plastic invades a balanced ecosystem, it corrupts it completely. The marine biome is one that is affected by this product. The animals in the ocean die of suffocation, ingestion of plastics, and entanglement. The animals affected are seagulls, whales, seals, fish, and turtles, and that's just a few. The animals eat so much plastic that they die of constipation from it.\u00a0Another reason is the presence of microplastics in food and people. About 99% of fish have microplastics in their stomachs, livers, and filets (the meat of fish). Approximately 80% of cows have microplastics in their meat and milk. A good point is that mealworms and waxworms are studied to digest plastics, and they should be added to landfills to break down plastics. There are about 50,000 particles of plastic in an adult person, and this number is rising fast.\u00a0Third, most plastic is littered. There are about 10 million tons of plastic litter every year. Every week, you ingest about a credit card's worth of plastic. There are about 44 million pounds of plastic that are produced that is very deadly to the environment.\"The plastic in the environment is in your water, food, and body. These plastics should not be there; they can lead to cancer, according to a recent study. We need to stop using plastic in our lives.\u00a0Some ways we can reduce the amount of plastic on earth are by using sustainable materials such as wood, plant fibers, and mushroom styrofoam. We can also try to buy recyclable plastics that have a triangle formed by three cycling arrows. Use a tote bag instead of a plastic one, or a metal and glass straw instead of a plastic one. You can also use a metal cutlery kit instead of plastic. These are all ways you can make a difference in your everyday life."

        "output": "An important general difference in the focus and purpose between machine learning and the traditional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is that machine learning is more oriented towards applications than explaining the basic nature of the underlying phenomena. Machine Learning is relatively less concerned with identifying the specific relations between the involved variables. For example, uncovering the nature of the underlying functions or the specific types of interactive, multivariate dependencies between variables are not the main goal of machine learning. Instead, the focus is on producing a solution that can generate useful predictions. Machine Learning accepts among others a \"black box\" type approach to data exploration or knowledge discovery and uses not only the traditional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, but also such techniques as Neural Networks which can generate valid predictions but are not capable of identifying the specific nature of the interrelations between the variables on which the predictions are based."

        "input": "",
        "output": "There are several, in fact! The most famous example would be the Okavango River, which - instead of reaching the ocean - peters out into the massive Okavango Delta and evaporates, in the middle of the Kalahari Desert. Some other notable instances include the Onyx River - the longest river in Antarctica, at 32 kilometres in length - which simply flows from one lake to another. And the Omo River, which starts in the Ethiopian Highlands and ends in Lake Turkana, Kenya. But these last two flow into lakes. That\u2019s not unusual for a river, right?\nCertainly not; however, in the vast majority of cases, the river\u2019s water will meet the sea eventually, as almost all lakes are drained by other rivers which reach the ocean. Not so for these lakes. Why? Because they\u2019re in what are known as endorheic basins. In hydrology, a basin is a region in which all precipitation will drain and collect into a common outlet. There are innumerable river basins throughout the world, with dozens in the (contiguous) US alone. If you look closely at the US map, you might notice that not all these river basins enter the sea. They are endorheic basins; closed, self-contained systems where the amount of water flowing in is equal to the amount which evaporates or seeps away.\nYou can theoretically find them in any climate, but they tend to be in very dry areas - e.g. the Kalahari - as where it\u2019s rainier erosion will usually carve pathways to the ocean. They also often have mountains or glaciers blocking their way to the sea. Endorheic basins make up about 18 per cent of the world\u2019s land area - although this map doesn\u2019t show the ones in Antarctica.\nAlso note that 6 of the world\u2019s 25 largest lakes are in endorheic basins - Lakes Turkana, Balkhash, Titicaca, Issyk-kul, and Urmia, and of course the Caspian Sea - the largest lake in all the world."

The meat is never frozen and tight quality controls at their processing plants insure a consistent and high quality meat patty.  The incentive structure for the In-n-out employee results in workers staying at the fast food chain longer with the manager frequently in charge of employees and the actual cooking of the burger patties.  This method is opposite of competing fast food restaurants who assign the burger cooking to entry level employees and customer management to higher levels.  In-n-out maintains a smaller menu focusing on a few key items instead of an expansive or seasonally themed menu making it easier to maintain high standards of quality.  Lastly their slow growth and enthusiastic fans provide a positive atmosphere lending itself to people thinking more highly of In-n-out where without this influence might be neutral on the brand."

Taylor for central banks to use to stabilize economic activity by appropriately setting short-term interest rates. The rule considers the federal funds rate, the price level and changes in real income. The Taylor rule computes the optimal federal funds rate based on the gap between the desired (targeted) inflation rate and the actual inflation rate; and the output gap between the actual and natural output level. According to Taylor, monetary policy is stabilizing when the nominal interest rate is higher/lower than the increase/decrease in inflation. Thus the Taylor rule prescribes a relatively high interest rate when actual inflation is higher than the inflation target."

        "output": "Karma is a central and fundamental aspect of Buddhist doctrine common to all traditions of Buddhism. The Buddhist concept of Karma is a natural process that operates with all our volitional actions and which does not need an external agency or power that sits in judgement.\n\nKarma in Buddhism should not be considered as moral justice, or a method of reward and punishment, that needs an external body or authority to decide whom or what should be punished and rewarded. It is believed that Gautama Buddha attained complete insight into how the process of Karma works during the night of his full enlightenment when, through the divine eye (dibbacakku), Buddha saw how other beings die and are reborn in happy and unhappy states according to their Karma.\n\nAccording to the Cula-kammavibhanga sutta of the Majima Nikava (collection of the middle length discourses of the Buddha), a young brahmin by the name of Subha had approached the Buddha and inquired as to why there was so much inequality among human beings in terms of being short-lived or long-lived, sickly or healthy, ugly or beautiful, powerful or powerless, poor or rich, low-born or high-born, ignorant or intelligent, etc. Buddha had then explained that:\n\"all living beings are the owners of their actions, heirs to their actions, they originate from their actions, they are related through their actions, they have their actions as their refuge and that it is action or Karma that distinguishes beings as inferior and superior\n\nThe word Karma in Pali, and karma in Sanskrit, means action but encompasses only actions that are intentional, volitional and willful and which will lead to consequences sooner or later. The mind (citta) by itself cannot perform or direct any mental, verbal or physical action and it is the intention, will, mental effort or volition (cetana) that directs any mental, verbal or physical action.\n\nThus the Buddha declared:\n\"Cetanaham bhikkhave kammam vadami\nCetayitva kammam karoti, kayena, vacaya, manasa\"\n\n\"It is volition that I call Karma, by volition one performs Karma through body, word or mind.\""

        "input": "",
        "output": "There are several things to consider when baking a cake.  Paying particular attention to each will produce a consistent and delicious result.  First, confirm that your oven temperature is correct.  This is easily done with a meat thermometer.  Place the thermometer in the middle of the center rack of the oven, where most food cooks. Then preheat the oven to a baking temperature (e.g. 350 degrees).  After the oven has preheated, check the temperature on the thermometer and confirm that it also reads 350 degrees.   Second, bring your refrigerated ingredients to room temperature before using.  If your recipe calls for butter, do not microwave it as a shortcut.  Doing so will change the consistency of your batter.  Plan ahead and leave butter and eggs out on the counter for at least an hour before you begin baking.  Third, pay close attention to recipe instructions related to sifting and measuring flour.  \"Two cups sifted flour\" does not mean the same thing as \"two cups flour, sifted.\"  The first instruction means to sift the flour, then measure; whereas the second means measure first, then sift what was measured.  In either scenario, do not scoop the measuring cup into the flour bin directly.  This causes the flour to be tightly packed into the cup and will result in a cake that has the texture of a brick.  Instead, use a spoon to lightly scoop flour from the bin into the measuring cup, leveling off the top with a butter knife.  This method is messier, but will yield better results.  Fourth, take the time to cream the butter and sugar well.  The result should be smooth and lump free.  This is the most important step to making an appealing cake, and again can't be expedited by using melted butter!  Fifth, if your recipe calls for both wet ingredients (buttermilk, juice etc) and dry (flour mixture), alternate between the two in small increments rather than dumping them in sequentially.  This small step will protect the texture of your cake.  Sixth, once the cake batter has been poured into the pan, lift the pan and drop it onto the counter from a height of two to three inches.  This will remove any air pockets that may have developed in the batter.  Be careful not to bang the pan too hard, or you'll spill the batter and/or scare your pets out of the kitchen.   And lastly, don't bake the cake for as long as the recipe suggests. Set the timer a few minutes early so that you don't over-bake due to any idiosyncrasy associated with your oven (referenced in step one). Please note this does not mean you should be opening and closing the oven door multiple times during the baking process.  Good bakers know \"if you're looking, it's not cooking,\" so try not to open the oven until your timer goes off.  The only exception to this rule is if you smell something burning.  Odds are this means the batter has spilled out over the pan and onto the bottom of the oven.  if this happens, and the oven is now smoking, you have to open the door and try to remove the spill.  If nothing is smoking, leave the mess until the cake is out and the oven has cooled.  Back to the timer - When it goes off, quickly but carefully test the cake with several toothpicks in different areas while the cake remains in the oven. (Taking the cake in and out of the oven to test will change the temperature of both the oven and the cake).  If the toothpicks are wet and sticky, the cake needs more time. If the toothpicks are clean (or a tad moist), the cake is ready to come out of the oven.   Allow cake to cool on a rack, and then enjoy the fruits of your labor!"

Second, the public does not care about politics so they don't pay attention to campaign functions like speeches, candidate gaffes, or advertising.  Third, in presidential elections, each side has about the same amount of experts and money which cancels out any advantage those resources might bring.\nOther scholars argue that campaigns do matter, and they also have three main reasons for this.  One, that after controlling for incumbency, campaign spending does impact a candidates performance. Secondly, Gerber and Green argue that campaigns personalized outreach, such as, door-to-door or digital contact, will influence the person contacted to go and vote for the candidate.

First, it's important to remain patient and diligent around maintaining a strict schedule for feeding, rest, play and potty times.  This should start the  moment your puppy arrives as this is going to set them and you up for success.  Second, when accidents happen, which will occur for the first few weeks, remember to be patient and kind to your puppy.  This will develop a deep sense of trust in you as the authority figure in the home.  \n\nGenerally, puppies need to be let outside to go potty outside within a secure area after waking, playtime and after every meal.  It's important not to confuse potty time with playtime and that your puppy is placed safely in a crate or gated area if they aren't being watched closely.   \n\nHow do you know when your puppy needs to go potty?  \n\nMost puppies will begin sniffing the ground when they need to go potty so if you witness this happening indoors, quickly usher your puppy outside or to a training pad.  It's important to provide your puppy a lot of praise for a job well done.  For some puppies, verbal praise from their family member while providing them with a small treat will help your puppy make the connection that going potty in the appropriate area is a very good thing for them and for you."

These economists may also be concerned with antitrust policy and its impact on market structure.\n- Macroeconomists study historical trends in the whole economy and forecast future trends in areas such as unemployment, inflation, economic growth, productivity, and investment. \nFinancial Economists study the money and banking system and the effects of rising interest rates. \n- Public Finance Economists primarily are involved in studying the role of the government in the economy and the effects of tax cuts, budget deficits, and welfare policies.\nInternational Economists study international financial markets, exchange rates, and the effects of various trade policies such as tariffs.\n- Labor Economists study the supply and demand for labor and the determination of wages. These economists also try to explain the reasons for unemployment, and the effects on labor markets of changing demographic trends such as an aging population and increasing immigration. \n- Econometricians are involved in all areas of economics and use mathematical techniques such as calculus, game theory, and regression analysis to formulate economic models. These models help to explain economic relationships and are used to develop forecasts related to the nature and length of business cycles, the effects of a specific rate of inflation on the economy, the effects of tax legislation on unemployment levels, and other economic phenomena. Many economists have applied these fundamental areas of economics to more narrow areas with specific applications such as health, education, agriculture, urban and regional economics, law, history, energy, and the environment. \n\nEconomists may work in Business, Finance Government and Academia."

As of today, a decent professional digital camera significantly outperforms the 35mm film cameras in terms of resolution, burst-shooting capabilities, nearly unlimited storage, and etc... In the recent years, the \"film look\" has made its comeback with lower resolution, grainy texture and unique color rendition. On top of that, half-decent retro-looking film cameras can be acquired for much less than a potent digital camera, lowering the entry barrier for those on the budget and looking for that look. An abundant pool of film stocks also adds to the fun, where each can drastically differ in low-light sensitivity, color rendition, graininess, post-processing chemistry, and of course, price. However, many major photographic film producers have either discontinued or significantly reduced the volume of their production. This, coupled with the surge in the demand, has led to skyrocketing prices on most of the still-available film stocks. On top of this, many popular and sought-after film cameras like the Leica M6, Nikon FM2 and Contax T2 also saw steep increase in their used-market prices. Given these price hikes on films and decades-old equipments, film photography is quickly becoming an expensive hobby, where each click of a shutter could cost more than 50 cents. How ironic is this today, when digital storage is virtually free? The authentic \"film look\" carries a hefty price tag today, and the future popularity of film photograhy is uncertain."

        "output": "For companies that are incorporated in Delaware, the Delaware General Corporation Law permits corporations to divide their boards of directors into up to 3 classes.  Other states in the United States have similar provisions regarding classified boards.\n\nFor boards that have only 1 class, each director serves a fixed term (generally 1 year), and each director is subject to re-election each year.  \n\nClassified boards (also known as staggered boards) are divided into three separate classes (in equal proportion, to the extent possible), with members of each class serving three-year terms and only one class of directors up for election in any year.  \n\nA classified board is one type of protection that companies consider as part of a wider range review of corporate defensive measures.  Generally, corporate defensive measures relate to measures for a company to consider to protect against (1) hostile takeovers that the board believes do not reflect the value of the company and (2) short-termism, where there is pressure from public investors \u2013 particularly activist investors \u2013 to take board actions (or face the risk of being voted off the board) that the board believes are not in the best interest of the company and its stockholders and maximizing value over the long term.  Corporate defensive measures generally aren\u2019t relevant when a company is private given the corporate structure with significant long-term investor representation on the board and various agreements in place with stockholders.  However, these measures become relevant once a company has public stockholders, so many companies who are considering an initial public offering will assess what types of defensive measures would be appropriate for them.\n\nA classified board is viewed as corporate defensive measure (i.e., it\u2019s an anti-takeover and activist defense) as the entire board can\u2019t be replaced in a single election cycle (with 3 classes, it would take up to the 3rd election cycle for the full board to be replaced, and generally 2 years to capture a majority)."

Stephen Curry, the Warriors best player, also won the NBA Most Valuable Player award twice during that same span.  This success is generally regarded as a dynasty, a term used to describe a dominating team over a long period.\n\nHowever, this season the Warriors have struggled.  Despite winning the most recent NBA championship only 9 months ago, near the end of this regular season they are only a few games above .500.  Their current record is 42-38 as of today, which is only the 13th best record in the NBA out of 30 teams.\n\nThe reason for the drop is not clear.  The Warriors have the same starting lineup as last year with 4 All-Stars and when playing at Home their record is among the best in the league.  However, when playing on the road the Warriors have one of the worst records at 9-30.  A big factor in their road losses is lack of good defense, as opposing teams score considerably more points against the Warriors than when the Warriors play at home.  There seems to be a lack of focus and intensity from the Warriors players on defense in these away games and in the NBA, where the margin between winning and losing is very thin, that has seemed to make the difference."

        "output": "List of Cons of Nuclear Fusion\n1. It is extremely difficult to achieve. \nIn stars, strong gravitational forces and high temperatures naturally create a fusion environment. But here on Earth, we are facing the challenge to make nuclear fuel hot and confined enough to start a self-sustaining ignition.\n\nImagine trying to contain the plasma (a gaseous mixture of deuterium, tritium atoms and ions, and helium the fusion product) at 100 million degrees celsius. No material can withstand that temperature. So, scientists attempt to keep the plasma (being electrically charged and having a magnetic field of its own) suspended in a magnetic field produced by superconducting magnets around the fusion chamber/vessel. This is similar to how bullet trains float on their tracks at ridiculous speeds. This process is very difficult to achieve (as compared to nuclear FISSION).\n\n2. It produces radioactive waste.\nThough nuclear power plants only emit negligible amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, its nuclear fuel chain process does produce radioactive waste.\n\nThe radioactive waste produced with fusion is not the same as with fission, and the two are often confused. With a nuclear fission reactor, the radiation is alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays (which can penetrate your skin and break apart the bonds in your DNA structure, giving you all kinds of cancer). In contrast, in a nuclear fusion reactor, the vessel wall is the only part that will be bombarded by the high energy neutrons, and if, in the worst case, all the protective layers surrounding the main fusion vessel fail, the neutron radiation will stop as soon as fusion reaction stops. In a fission reactor, the cancer-causing radiation still exists even in the waste materials, which means that extreme measures are needed to burry the waste to keep it as far away as possible from humans. In the case of nuclear fusion, the activated materials (i.e., the metal vessels which have been bombarded by neutrons) can be stored safely for about 100 years, after which the radiation level becomes so low that they can be reused in the fusion reactor again."

While many learn to ski when they're young, there are lots of people that only started to ski at an older age. With the right motivation and a willingness to put time and effort, almost anyone can learn to ski. Also, advances to ski equipment and slope grooming technology make skiing a lot safer than it used to be years ago.\n\nLearning to ski as an adult may take longer than learning as a child. It is recommended that you start with some lessons first to gain the right technique. This could be group lessons or private lessons. You could also learn from friends who know how to ski, or learn by watching online tutorials and applying them yourself on the mountain. Once you have the basic skills, you should be able to ski easy slopes and start enjoying skiing as a fun activity. \n\nIn addition to lessons, you will also need the right gear to ski. This includes appropriate clothing that can keep you warm on the mountain while you ski, as well as ski equipment that you will use. It is recommended that you get a pair of skis and poles, good fitting boots, a helmet for safety, and goggles to protect your eyes from the elements. Renting your equipment is a good option when you're starting. That way you are not making an expensive commitment upfront. You could also buy your equipment either new or from any of the second-hand ski shops and ski swaps.\n \nWith the right gear and knowledge of the basics, you can take your learning in any direction you want. Many people choose to stay at a beginner or intermediate level and just enjoy the occasional ski trip with friends. While others take their passion forward with more practice, hours on the mountain, and likely more lessons to get to advanced levels.\n\nWhichever path you pick, skiing can be a fun sport to learn and enjoy for the rest of your life.

        "input": "",
        "output": "This can be explained by the difference in pressure between the outside and inside of the refrigerator. In order to understand the phenomenon, let's first break down the relationship between pressure and temperature. Warmer air has a higher pressure than cooler air, it has to do with the energy of air molecules but that is a subject for another time. When you open the refrigerator door, warmer air from the surroundings, which would be at room temperature, rushes inside the refrigerator. This is because the air flows from the higher-pressure region (the room), into the lower-pressure region (inside the refrigerator). When you shut the door, the warm air that had moved inside is now actively being cooled down by the refrigerator. Remember what we said about cooler air? The pressure inside the refrigerator starts to drop. This means that warmer air at higher pressure outside the refrigerator is trying to get in and is pushing against the door, the next time you try to open the door, you need to apply an extra force to counteract that pressure that is acting on the door. So that begs the question, why is this more noticeable a short time after you shut the door versus coming back let's say, an hour later? Glad you asked! It is because the seal that keeps the warm air outside and cool air inside the refrigerator is not a perfect seal, it is not designed to be for good reason. Over time, since the seal allows the movement of air, the pressure equalizes. In the absence of that pressure differential, there is no force acting on the outside of the door forcing it shut. Fun fact, commercial refrigerators have seals designed to allow for a lot more movement of air compared to home refrigerators. Want to guess why? It is because content inside commercial refrigerators needs to be accessed a lot more frequently. If their seals were similar to home refrigerators, people would experience the extra force each time they want to get something! It is fascinating how much thought goes into designing everyday things we take for granted!"

They may protect water supplies, yield wood, harbor wildlife,and provide space to recreate.We are concerned about the level of harvest, the adjacent land use, pollution from nearby industries, or where forests burn. Informed management requires knowledge of all these related factors and, perhaps above all, the spatial arrangement of these factors. Buffer strips near rivers may protect water supplies,clearings may prevent the spread of fire, and polluters upwind may harm our forests. A GIS helps us analyze these spatial interactions, and is also particularly useful at displaying spatial data and analysis. A GIS is often the only way to solve spatially-related problems."

There were various governing arrangements provided by the AoC, but the most important was protecting the power or sovereignty of the states.  The state would not have ratified the AoC if the federal government did not guarantee the powers of the states. The AoC defined a federal government with a unicameral legislature (one vote per state).  This legislation had the following powers: declare war, conduct \u201cforeign or commercial relations with other countries\u201d (i.e. treaties), and executive functions that would be carried out by legislative committees. It also \u201csuggested a federal court system\u201d.  This federal government was to be funded by the states.\nThough it provided these powers to the federal government, there were inherent weaknesses built into the federal government. First, there was no way for the legislature to enforce its decisions. Second, a declared war or commercial treaty required the consent of at least 9 states. Even if a war was approved, there was no federal army, only state militias. Third, the federal government relied on the states for funding.  If the states didn\u2019t like legislation passed, they could simply withhold funding. Fourth, amendments to the AoC required the unanimous agreement of all thirteen states.  A realization came that these weaknesses inhibited the governing ability of the federal government.  This set the stage for dropping the AoC, which then lead to the current Constitution of the United States."

        "output": "A turnover is when the offensive team, the team with possession of the football, loses possession of the football during play. This generally occurs in two ways: the defense intercepting a pass or recovering a fumble. A turnover on downs occurs only on the fourth and last down of a set of downs; the offense attempts to gain the yardage required to be given a new set of downs but fails to do so by means other than the defense's takeaway, such as an incomplete pass, or the ball carrier being tackled short of the line to gain."

        "instruction": "How do we increase voter turnout in the United States?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Voter turnout in the United States varies from state to state and, as a whole, is comparatively low with respect to other democracies. There are institutional as well as psychological factors that affect turnout. Institutional factors include voter registration requirements, timing and frequency of elections, location of polling places, and complexity of ballots. Psychological factors include political efficacy, interest and engagement of the electorate, and political party membership. Voter turnout in the United States can be increased, and I will propose two simple reforms that would increase voter turnout. I will also propose another more complex reform that would dramatically increase voter turnout but would be difficult to implement by the state governments.\nSeveral institutional factors determine voter turnout. As each state has the power to hold elections, these factors vary across the states. The difficulty or ease of voter registration will have an impact on turnout. Minnesota has a very high turnout allowing same-day voter registration, while Texas has a low turnout and has a 30-day requirement. The day and time an election is also held matters. For example, the U.S. holds federal elections on a Tuesday in November during work hours which reduces voter turnout. The frequency of elections will have an influence on turnout. There are many elections per year in the U.S., and voters get fatigued and stop going to the polls. Voters are also less likely to vote if they don't have convenient polling places that are nearby and easy to access. Schools are the best and most accessible polling locations, but the U.S. holds elections on Tuesdays, which limits the availability of school space and parking. Lastly, complex ballots diminish enthusiasm and negatively impact U.S. voter turnout.\nAlong with institutional factors, there are psychological factors that control voter turnout. One of which is political efficacy which is defined in two ways. The first is internal efficacy which is how well you think you are able to understand politics. The second is external efficacy which is how well you feel the system responds to your input. Essentially, if you think you are smart enough and your vote \"matters,\" you have high efficacy and tend to go to the polls. The next psychological factor is interest, which is a measure of how much you care about politics. If you don't care, it's highly unlikely that you will vote. The last psychological factor is partisanship. Are you a member of a political party? If yes, then it's more likely you'll go vote to support your party. \nBy voting age population, turnout in the U.S. is around 53%. This shows the United States has a low turnout compared to other democracies and puts the U.S. 7th from the bottom when compared to 35 other democracies. Australia has the highest turnout, with just over 90%. The reason for Australia's high turnout is that voting is compulsory, with fines for people who don't vote. \"Voting in Australia is like a party,\" with election day described as a country-wide BBQ with easy-to-access polling locations held on a Saturday. In Australia, \"Forcing people to engage in the process increases their knowledge of the issues and candidates,\" thereby increasing Australia's political interest and engagement. By contrast, polls in the U.S. consistently show us that Americans don't know much about politics and are neither engaged nor interested in politics. Converse argues that people in the U.S. have low levels of ideological constraint and conceptualization. This shows that Americans have low political efficacy.\n\tIn general American turnout is low, but Voter Eligible Population (VEP) turnout varies dramatically across the states. Hawaii has the least VEP turnout, with approximately 43%. To compare, the state with the highest VEP turnout is Minnesota, with 75%. Texas comes in 3rd from the bottom with 53%. Minnesota's high turnout is explained by \"easy access to the ballot,\" \"a sense of civic responsibility,\" \"high rates of educational attainment and income,\" and \"competitive and interesting elections.\" By comparison, the main reasons Hawaii turnout is so low are that it's \"hard to register,\" voter disinterest and low efficacy, and it's a \"one-party state\". This combination of institutional and psychological factors, beneficial in Minnesota, and detrimental in Hawaii, has a significant impact on a state's turnout. \n\tI propose two simple solutions to increase voter turnout. The first would be to move elections to the weekend or require that companies give employees the day off to vote. Sunday is the most common election day in the world outside the United States. I believe this would be a beneficial institutional factor that would increase voter turnout because the majority of other countries have higher voter turnout than the United States. Unfortunately, the chances of this happening are slim as Congress has proposed bills to move elections to the weekend or have a Federal holiday for voting, but these bills have never moved out of committees.\n\tThe second simple solution would address the institutional factor of registration requirements by implementing same-day voter registration in all 50 states. Minnesota allows for same-day registration, and its turnout is around 20% higher than Texas, which does not allow it. States that have implemented same-day voter registration have seen an average of a 5% increase in voters (\"Same Day Voter\"). To prevent voter fraud, systems should be put in place to make sure the voter hasn't already voted and to check for valid identification showing the voter is a resident of the state or county. Another deterrent to committing voter fraud would be criminal penalties, including jail time and fines. Enacting legislation in each state to implement a system to handle would take time, but I think it's possible as currently, 21 states allow same-day voting registration (\"Same Day Voter\"). \n\tThe third solution I propose would address most of the institutional factors. This would be an online/app-based voting option. The vast majority of Americans these days have mobile phones with internet connections. Those that don't would still have all of the current voting options, such as polling locations and mail-in voting. Security and verification would combine blockchain (similar to Bitcoin identities), biometrics, and facial recognition artificial intelligence. When registering to vote, a state agency would create your blockchain voter identification, fingerprint, and take a LiDAR(Light Detection and Ranging) 3D map of your face. These three technologies would ensure one vote per person. Also, this technology is all readily available and, while complex to implement, would provide several advantages over our current voting system. It would eliminate the need for convenient polling locations, as you can vote anywhere. The timing of elections would be fine, as you could vote during a work break. The frequency of elections would also be less of an issue because you wouldn't have to go to a polling location. The complexity of the ballot could be addressed in the application, which would allow links showing descriptions of candidates and issues.\n\tWhile voter turnout in the United States is low compared to other democratic countries, there are both simple and complex solutions that can increase voter participation. States with high voter turnout should be models for other states to follow as they have implemented practical reforms like same-day voter registration. The United States can then look to other countries and enact common sense solutions like voting on the weekend or on election holidays. Finally, we can use technology safely and responsibly to take voting into the 21st century and remove all the barriers to voting that our existing system places between the voter and the ballot."

While there are various hypotheses as to reason for these effects, the most likely explanation is some level of optical illusion as the road is tilted at a severe opposite angle to the tilted roof line and the inside of the cabin. I think a combination of gravity hill where you get the sensation you are climbing up the road when in reality you are going down and the odd tilted angles of the cabin causes severe optical illusion.

        "output": "This article lists English association football clubs whose men's sides have won competitive honours run by official governing bodies. Friendly competitions and matches organized between clubs are not included. The football associations FIFA and UEFA run international and European competitions; while The Football Association, and its mostly self-governing subsidiary bodies the English Football League and Premier League, run national competitions.\n\nThe European governing body UEFA was founded in 1954, and created their first and most prestigious competition, the European Cup, the next year. It was expanded and renamed in 1992 as the UEFA Champions League. Liverpool hold the English record, with six wins. Parallel to UEFA, various officials created the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1955, but this competition was disbanded when UEFA created the replacement tournament, UEFA Cup, in 1971 (renamed the UEFA Europa League in 2009) The English record number of Europa League wins is three, also held by Liverpool. Another competition absorbed into the UEFA Cup, in 1999, was the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, which was created in 1960 and featured the winners of national knockout competitions The winners of this competition played the European Cup winners in the UEFA Super Cup, starting in 1972 (recognised by UEFA in 1973), which now features the winners of the Champions League and Europa League.Liverpool also hold the English record, with four wins, in the UEFA Super Cup. The International Football Cup, also known as the UEFA Intertoto Cup, was a competition for clubs not participating in the European Cup, UEFA Cup or Cup Winners' Cup. The tournament commenced in 1961, but UEFA officially recognised it only in 1995, and discontinued in 2008, with the Europa League expanded to accommodate Intertoto Cup clubs. UEFA and CONMEBOL also created an intercontinental competition in 1960, the Intercontinental Cup, featuring continental champions from both associations. In 2000, the international governing body FIFA created the FIFA Club World Cup and in 2004 the Intercontinental Cup was merged into it. Manchester United are the only English club to have won the Intercontinental Cup, while United, Chelsea and Liverpool are the only English teams to have lifted the Club World Cup.\n\nEngland's first competition organised by a national body, the FA Cup, began in the 1871\u201372 season, making it one of the oldest football competitions in the world.Arsenal hold the record number of wins, with 14. League football began in the next decade with the founding of The Football League in 1888\u201389. The name First Division was adopted in 1892, when The Football League gained a second division. The First Division remained the highest division of the English league system until 1992, when the Premier League was founded. Manchester United have won the most top division titles, 20. The English equivalent of the super cup began in 1898 with the inauguration of the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, pitting the best professional and amateur sides of the year against each other. The trophy would develop into the FA Charity Shield in 1908, which was later renamed the FA Community Shield in 2002. Manchester United also hold the record here, with 21 wins. The Football League created its own knockout competition in 1960, the League Cup. Its current record is nine wins, held by Liverpool. The Anglo-Italian League Cup was created in 1969 to match English cup winners against the winners of the Coppa Italia, and was permanently disbanded in 1976. In 1985, the Full Members' Cup and Football League Super Cup were created as substitutes for UEFA competitions after UEFA responded to the Heysel Stadium disaster by banning English clubs. They finished in 1992 and 1986, respectively. The Football League Centenary Trophy marked The Football League's 100th birthday, in the 1988\u201389 season \n\nLower down in the hierarchy of English football are many other competitions, not included in the tables on this page. These include competitions run by the above national governing bodies, but organised for clubs ineligible for higher competitions. For example, the Texaco Cup and EFL Trophy. Regional competitions are organised by County Football Associations. In the years when league football was unavailable or only available to northern and midlands clubs, the county competitions coexisted with the FA Cup as the main tournaments for clubs. Nowadays, county cups are contested by lower or regional division teams and those that still participate generally field youth or reserve sides."

Fish in the right place! Most freshwater fish have an environment preference. For example, summer bass like to be in weeds and other cover; spring walleye can be found in more shallow water with sandy/rocky bottoms; fall pike and musky ambush prey from thick weed beds. If you want to catch a lot of fish, you need to be fishing where the fish are!"

Additionally, your ballot must be received by election day.  Ballots received after the election date will not be counted--regardless of whether the delay was the responsibility of the postal service.   If you are concerned that there is not enough time for the postal service to return the ballot on time, you can drop off your absentee ballot in person at your polling site on the day of the election, or you can simply vote in person at the polling site.

        "input": "",
        "output": "The least common birthday in the modern Gregorian calendar is February 29. This is because of leap years, as February 29 occurs only a bit more than a quarter of the time in any given calendar year.\n\nHowever excluding February 29, in most Western countries the least common birthday is December 25. For instance, in the United States between 1973 and 1999, September 16 is the most common birthday and December 25 the least common birthday. Some other uncommon birthdays in the West are January 1, December 24, and April 1.\n\nThe least common birthday is usually a holiday when most people take time off work. There are multiple reasons why these days have fewer births, but one reason is that doctors are less likely to schedule cesarean births on such days. April 1 is an exception, and is likely because parents who are able to choose not to give birth on that day, to prevent their children from being bullied for having their birthday on April Fool's Day.\n\nThis question is harder to answer in many non-Western countries as there is less easily accessible data. For example in a survey of students in India between 2007 and 2012, the statistics show much more births just before school opens, and on round days like the 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th. This indicates much of the data may be faked."

        "output": "A bank run is a sudden and drastic event that occurs when all the depositors in a bank rush to withdraw their deposits at the same time or within a very short timeframe. As more depositors withdraw their money, the rest of the depositor's fears of a bank's insolvency increase, therefore driving more depositors to withdraw their money. The only thing that can stop a bank run is everyone stopping from withdrawing their money, however this is a good example of game theory since the benefits of stopping individual's withdrawals benefits the whole system but is against the individual's benefit while withdrawing the individual's money benefits the individual but affects the whole system. Banks typically don't have the entirety of their depositors' money available for withdrawal. During a bank run they have to increase their cash positions, sometimes selling assets at a loss, increasing the likelihood of the bank's collapse."

Next, they excavate, or dig, to find evidence of past habitations. This results in recovering material culture, or artifacts. The artifacts are then taken to a laboratory where they are analyzed. This analysis including cleaning the artifacts, determining dates and functions, and entering those artifacts into a database where further statistical analysis may be performed. Once all this data is gathered and analyzed, archaeologist need to interpret what they have found. This data can tell you when a site was occupied, who lived there, what they were eating, and what time of year a site was occupied. Once the archaeologists have interpreted the data the write a report detailing the work that was done and their interpretation of the site. The report is very detailed as archaeological excavation destroys the sites being studying. The report includes photographs, field notes, and an inventory of the artifacts recovered as well as an interpretation of the site."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest is very possible, but can present a number of challenges. The three biggest concerns revolve around:\n\n1. A short growing season\n2. Cooler summers\n3. Wetter than average summers\n\nHere are some solutions you can use to mitigate these challenges.\n\nDo deal with the short growing season, you need to get a headstart on growing by using starters. What this means is that instead of planting a seed in the ground in Springtime, you start a seed indoors in late winter, grow it into a small to medium plant, then transplant that \"starter\", into the ground when the temperature is warm enough. You can buy starters from Nurseries, or start your own at home. Nursery starters are easier, but by growing at home you can experiment with more rare varieties and gain experience in cultivating a plant from the seedling stage. If you grow your own it's important to slowly climatize the plant to outdoor weather leading up to the transplant date by moving it outside starting with a couple hours a day, increasing an hour or two per day over 2-3 weeks. By using starters you essentially extend the growing season by giving your plant a multi month head start. \n\nTomatoes mature best in warm to hot climates. The pacific northwest has cooler summers than many of the growing regions in the world. There is not a lot we can do to control mother nature, but there are one or two methods to help yourself here. Certain varieties of tomatoes do better in cooler summers - try and select these. If you're using starts from a local nursery they can guide you - starts from big national box stores might not be the best for your local Northwest climate. Another technique, if you are experiencing a cooler than normal Spring and start of Summer, is to build a \"hoop house\", using PVC pipe frame and a visqueen tarp. This will let light in and act as a mini-greenhouse, trapping heat around the plant. Keep in mind tomatoes need pollinators like bees to produce fruit, so once the plan t begins to flower you'll want to ensure pollination can occur.\n\nMoisture creates issues with Tomato plants as they are very susceptible to various types of fungus that grow on the leaves. Blight is one in particular common among tomatoes. The wet summers we sometimes have create conditions on the leaves conducive to fungal growth, they can also splash fungus onto the leaves from the soil. The easiest way to deal with these two issues is in proper pruning. As early as you can prune any lower sets of leaves that could possibly come into contact with the ground. Don't do this too soon as the plant needs some leaves to grow. There are many ways to prune a tomato that you can read about, but one common one in wet areas is called single stemming - in this technique you prune \"suckers\", which are the small offshoots that grow in between the main stem and the leaf stems. By pruning the suckers you prevent too much bushy growth, which will help the leaves dry out with airflow after a rain storm. The last issue related to water is that heavy late season rains will cause the fruits to swell with water and crack. There's not an easy solution here. If it's towards the end of the season and a rainstorm is coming in, this can be a good time to pick all your fruit, your green tomatoes can be used for green salsas. Some will resort to building a tarp structure above the plants to stop the rain, though this can require a bit more work and ingenuity, and you'll need another system to keep the plants watered.\n\nOverall, growing tomatoes in the Pacific Northwest is totally possible and very rewarding. Hopefully these tips help you to have a fruitful growing season!"

Usually for sales/services transactions it is a fee that a merchant's bank (the \"acquiring bank\") pays a customer's bank (the \"issuing bank\").\n\nIn a credit card or debit card transaction, the card-issuing bank in a payment transaction deducts the interchange fee from the amount it pays the acquiring bank that handles a credit or debit card transaction for a merchant. The acquiring bank then pays the merchant the amount of the transaction minus both the interchange fee and an additional, usually smaller, fee for the acquiring bank or independent sales organization (ISO), which is often referred to as a discount rate, an add-on rate, or passthru. For cash withdrawal transactions at ATMs, however, the fees are paid by the card-issuing bank to the acquiring bank (for the maintenance of the machine)."

Although there have been many different swing styles over the years, there are fundamentals to playing the game that when followed, have produced the most successful golfers. \n\nBuilding a strong golf foundation using 4 key principles is key to improving at the game of golf which are: aligning your expectations to reality, applying an effective on course strategy, practicing correctly, and, building a sharp mental game.\n\nBy aligning your expectations to the reality of how you are playing, you allow your mind to accept the good with the bad which allows for a more free and easy playing style, often leading to better play.\n\nApplying an effective course strategy will allow you to score better as you know where you can make up strokes on your competitors.  For example, driving distance off the tee paired with greens in regulation play a crucial role in scoring, as opposed to putting whereas you have a 20 foot putt compared to a 40 foot putt, your make percentages are both low.\n\nLearning how to practice correctly can also improve your on course scoring as most approach practice incorrectly.  Zombie range sessions have become the norm, but rarely in golf do you have the same shot twice in a row.  Implement that same theory on the driving range so you have more of a feel of what on course play will feel like.\n\nFinally, in order to improve your scoring, you need to build a sharp mental game while you play.  This includes visualizing your shot before you hit it, being able to clear your head of all unwanted thoughts other than the shot you want to hit, and implementing a pre shot routine that is easily replicable.\n\nBy applying these core 4 strategies, you should see your golf scores decrease without any significant change in your actual swing."

The interval between each successive pair of strings is a perfect fourth, except the major third interval between G and B, making some figures and phrases 'translate' horizontally across the neck. The perfect fourth interval helps avoid long finger stretches in comparison to the perfect fifth intervals on smaller instruments like the violin. The introduction of a major third between G and B means that the total interval between 1st and 6th string is 24 semitones, or 2 octaves, making the open guitar strings fall more easily into chords, aiding fretting of basic chords with fewer fingers."

When new discoveries in scenic areas are correctly applied, you don\u2019t need to spend multiple hours at the gym, you don\u2019t have to starve to achieve your goals, this concept was very enticing to me when I first learnt about the Sprint 8 program at my local gym.  I decided to give this a try!\n\nSprint 8 - Its a 20 minute routine, where you spend the first 30 seconds working out at the highest level of intensity (go all out) followed by 90 seconds of active recovery, repeat this 8 times..  You can use a bike, treadmill, elliptical whichever suits your style.  In all my life of being fairly active, Sprint 8 has the toughest workout, but over a year I could see significant results.  I was able to run faster, lower blood pressure, reduce fat percentage, and improve muscle mass.  The key differentiator about this program is that it engages all the three muscle fiber types and releases exercise induced growth hormones to help your body become stronger, leaner and healthier.\n\nAnother advantage is that this program really reduces any change of injury that one may face by running, heavy weight lifting etc therefore allowing you to sustain the exercise program for years to come.  \n\nGive this a try and gain the benefits of efficient exercising."

        "output": "Taking good star photos requires 3 critical elements: good observation conditions, good equipment and plenty of time. Picking a dark site without a lot of light pollution that's away from cities and other strong sources of light is a must. The weather also has to be clear, without clouds, and preferably on a night without full moon which is another source of light pollution. On the equipment side, if you're planning to use a cellphone, make sure that it has a night mode and you have a way to keep it immobile for the duration of the photo, which could take 4 or more minutes. You will get better results with a digital camera as those have larger lenses which can capture more light. Also remember that the longer the photo, the more the earth will turn, causing your starts to appear as trails in the photo - which may or may not be desired. For professional looking photos you'll need a telescope, and remember that no matter what you do, your photos won't look anything like those coming from Hubble and other large telescopes. Lastly, plan on spending plenty of time - the longer the exposure the better you can see the stars, and you might want to take several photos - try different parts of the sky, see what happens when you include the ground or not, and remember to let your eyes adjust to the dark and look around yourself, while you're taking the photos!"

        "output": "Fractional-reserve banking is the system of banking operating in almost all countries worldwide, under which banks that take deposits from the public are required to hold a proportion of their deposit liabilities in liquid assets as a reserve, and are at liberty to lend the remainder to borrowers. Bank reserves are held as cash in the bank or as balances in the bank's account at the central bank. The country's central bank determines the minimum amount that banks must hold in liquid assets, called the \"reserve requirement\" or \"reserve ratio\". Most commercial banks hold more than this minimum amount as excess reserves.\n\nBank deposits are usually of a relatively short-term duration, and may be \"at call\", while loans made by banks tend to be longer-term, resulting in a risk that customers may at any time collectively wish to withdraw cash out of their accounts in excess of the bank reserves. The reserves only provide liquidity to cover withdrawals within the normal pattern. Banks and the central bank expect that in normal circumstances only a proportion of deposits will be withdrawn at the same time, and that reserves will be sufficient to meet the demand for cash. However, banks may find themselves in a shortfall situation when depositors wish to withdraw more funds than the reserves held by the bank. In that event, the bank experiencing the liquidity shortfall may borrow short-term funds in the interbank lending market from banks with a surplus. In exceptional situations, such as during an unexpected bank run, the central bank may provide funds to cover the short-term shortfall as lender of last resort."

It included philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza, David Hume, John Locke, Edward Gibbon, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot, Pierre Bayle and Isaac Newton. This movement is influenced by the scientific revolution in southern Europe arising directly from the Italian renaissance with people like Galileo Galilei. Over time it came to mean the Si\u00e8cle des Lumi\u00e8res, in English the Age of Enlightenment.[Note 1]\n\nMembers of the movement saw themselves as a progressive \u00e9lite, and battled against religious and political persecution, fighting against what they saw as the irrationality, arbitrariness, obscurantism and superstition of the previous centuries. They redefined the study of knowledge to fit the ethics and aesthetics of their time. Their works had great influence at the end of the 18th century, in the American Declaration of Independence and the French Revolution.\n\nThis intellectual and cultural renewal by the Lumi\u00e8res movement was, in its strictest sense, limited to Europe. These ideas were well understood in Europe, but beyond France the idea of \"enlightenment\" had generally meant a light from outside, whereas in France it meant a light coming from within oneself.\n\nIn the most general terms, in science and philosophy, the Enlightenment aimed for the triumph of reason over faith and belief; in politics and economics, the triumph of the bourgeois over nobility and clergy."

        "input": "",
        "output": "An assembler program creates object code by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents. This representation typically includes an operation code (\"opcode\") as well as other control bits and data. The assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves symbolic names for memory locations and other entities. The use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers, saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications. Most assemblers also include macro facilities for performing textual substitution \u2013 e.g., to generate common short sequences of instructions as inline, instead of called subroutines.\n\nSome assemblers may also be able to perform some simple types of instruction set-specific optimizations. One concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous x86 assemblers from various vendors. Called jump-sizing, most of them are able to perform jump-instruction replacements (long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps) in any number of passes, on request. Others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions, such as some assemblers for RISC architectures that can help optimize a sensible instruction scheduling to exploit the CPU pipeline as efficiently as possible."

There are several types of batteries available, and several ways of powering these batteries. The two main types of batteries are lead acid, and lithium. Lithium batteries are newer technology and will not be found in older RVs unless retrofitted. Lithium batteries have a larger charge capacity and can discharge safely further than lead acid batteries. However, lead acid batteries are cheaper. There are several ways of charging these batteries. The most common is a plug that provides either 30A or 50A of power, depending on the RV size. Most RVs also have generators, but generators are noisy and require either gas or diesel to run. Some RVs with lithium batteries (or more rarely, lead acid), have a second alternator installed that charges the batteries while driving. Finally, solar power is a popular option. Solar power is completely quiet and renewable, but can be expensive to install and is slower to charge batteries. Most RVs have a combination of the above, and consumers choose the system that best fits their lifestyle."

For example, yoga is great for increasing blood flow, reducing stress levels in the body, and improving flexibility. If you're interested in these benefits, as well as losing weight, I recommend exploring \"Hot Yoga\" as a more intense variation. Another method of getting into shape is through strength training. This type of workout is focused on lifting weights to put stress on your muscles. This stress leads to micro-tears in your muscles, which heal to become even stronger than before! Some great strength training workouts include; Squats, bench press, and bicep curls. If you are looking to begin a workout regiment that you can do rather independently, running is a great option. Running leads to increased cardiovascular health and muscular strength in your legs. All that is required is a high quality pair of shoes and a sidewalk, road, or trail!"

If it has been sunny and dry for a week and you are still getting the leak, shut the water off and see if the leak stops.  If it does, then that is likely from an internal leak.  If it is in fact an internal leak, then call a reputable local plumber to have them test your pipes for pressure loss.  If it is an external leak, then wait for sunny weather.  After about a week of dry sunny weather, get a garden hose and pick a feature of your roof or external walls and spray that feature (vent pipe, window, roof juncture, etc) with a direct stream of high volume and low velocity water from the garden hose.  Wait for a few hours, and see if the leak appears.  After four hours, if no leak has appeared, then move on to the next feature.  If hosing down a specific feature does in fact cause dripping within that four hour window, then either call a roof repair company or go to your local hardware store and talk to an expert about ways to seal cracks or gaps in siding or roofing material."

Commonly listed English parts of speech are noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, interjection, numeral, article, and determiner.\n\nAlmost all languages have the word classes noun and verb, but beyond these two there are significant variations among different languages. For example:\n\nJapanese has as many as three classes of adjectives, where English has one.\nChinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese have a class of nominal classifiers.\nMany languages do not distinguish between adjectives and adverbs, or between adjectives and verbs.\nBecause of such variation in the number of categories and their identifying properties, analysis of parts of speech must be done for each individual language.

In a more restricted sense, spatial analysis is geospatial analysis, the technique applied to structures at the human scale, most notably in the analysis of geographic data. It may also be applied to genomics, as in transcriptomics data.\n\nComplex issues arise in spatial analysis, many of which are neither clearly defined nor completely resolved, but form the basis for current research. The most fundamental of these is the problem of defining the spatial location of the entities being studied. Classification of the techniques of spatial analysis is difficult because of the large number of different fields of research involved, the different fundamental approaches which can be chosen, and the many forms the data can take."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The Unified Payments Interface is a Peer to Peer payments system launched in India by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in 2016. NPCI set out with a mandate to change the face of India\u2019s payment systems. It developed the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) as an architecture framework with a set of standard Application Programming Interface (API) specifications to facilitate online payments. The aim was to simplify and provide a single interface across all NPCI systems, thereby creating interoperability and a superior customer experience.\n\nUPI is now one of the most preferred payment solutions in India, with over a billion transactions every month. FY22, the total transaction value processed by the United Payments Interface (UPI) platform accounted for 86% of India\u2019s GDP. UPI\u2019s core function is to support easy and secure money transfers between bank accounts. It does this by adding multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application, allowing for seamless fund transfers and merchant payments from one place. It also enables \u2018peer to peer\u2019 and \u2018peer to merchant\u2019 collection requests, which can be scheduled and paid as requested.\n\nPayments can be made using a UPI ID, UPI Number, Account number, and an Indian Financial System Code (IFSC). Payment security is as per applicable Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines using a 1-click 2-factor authentication where the second factor of authentication is the UPI PIN. \n\nUPI can be accessed on all major platforms such as Android and iOS with apps developed by members for versions of Android 4.2.2 and iOS 8.1 and above.\n\nThe primary business uses of UPI are to allow a personal mobile as the primary device for all payments, including person to person, person to entity, and entity to person. Using a personal mobile an individual can \u2018Pay\u2019 someone (push) as well as \u2018Collect\u2019 from\nsomeone (pull). In addition, the ability to pay and collect using \u2018UPI IDs\u2019 that are \u2018aliases\u2019 to the VPA. The goal is to make  payments by providing an address without having to ever provide account details or credentials on third party applications or websites.\nAlso, sending \u2018collect\u2019 requests to others (person to person or entity to person) with a\u2018pay by\u2019 date, which allows customers to pay at a later date without blocking the money in the account. UPI also allows for pre-authorizing multiple recurring payments (utilities, school fees, subscriptions, etc.) with a one-time secure authentication and rule-based access, similar to ECS. UPI autopay allows customers to set recurring payments for their UPI transactions. Recurring payments up to Indian Rupees 2000 can be set at the frequency desired.\n\nThis makes payments using UPI a fully interoperable system across all PSPs without having silos and closed systems with one-click two-factor authentication, using a personal\nphone, and without any acquiring devices or physical tokens.\n\nIn March 2023, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) launched the linkage of UPI and Singapore\u2019s PayNow. Remittances from Singapore to India were on track to breach the $100 billion mark in 2023, making it the fourth highest remitting nation to India, accounting for 5.7% of all inbound remittances. Integrating PayNow and UPI will likely reduce charges and the time taken for such transactions."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Pickleball has indeed become very popular.  Promoters of the game have been calling it the \"fastest growing sport\" for some time now.\n\nThere are a few reasons many people cite for why the sport is so popular:\n\n- It is a quick game to learn.  The rules are pretty simple, and more importantly, the skill needed to hit functional shots in the game is not very difficult to learn.  Compare it to tennis, where it can take multiple lessons from a professional teacher just to get to a point where you can hit a few good shots.  With pickleball, almost anyone of any age or fitness level can pick up a paddle and be playing a game in just minutes.\n\n- Pickleball culture has tended to be very inclusive.  Many pickleball groups make it a point to be very inclusive of all ages, races and backgrounds.  This often creates a sense of community for players, and makes them more likely to keep playing and invite friends along, thus growing the sport.\n\n- It is a fun way to get in a decent workout.  While not as taxing as, say, tennis, pickleball can be a good workout.  Especially since unlike tennis there is very little downtime.  The pace of games is very quick and involves near constant movement.  The workout is not cardio-intensive, but still it is an easy way to have fun while staying active."

It is created using data derived from sensors (often IoT or IIoT) that are attached to or embedded in the original object. This data allows for both structural and operational views of what happens to the object in real-time, allowing engineers to monitor systems and model systems dynamics. Adjustments can be made to the digital twin to assess the impact of real-world changes before making any changes to the original system.\n\nFor a discrete or process manufacturing, a digital twin gathers process and system data with the help of various IoT sensors (both IT and OT) to form a virtual model which is then used to run simulations, study performance issues, and generate new insights."

He has been widely considered the wealthiest American of all time and the richest person in modern history. Rockefeller was born into a large family in Upstate New York that moved several times before eventually settling in Cleveland. He became an assistant bookkeeper at age 16 and went into several business partnerships beginning at age 20, concentrating his business on oil refining. Rockefeller founded the Standard Oil Company in 1870. He ran it until 1897 and remained its largest shareholder.\n\nRockefeller's wealth soared as kerosene and gasoline grew in importance, and he became the richest person in the country, controlling 90% of all oil in the United States at his peak. Oil was used throughout the country as a light source until the introduction of electricity, and as a fuel after the invention of the automobile. Furthermore, Rockefeller gained enormous influence over the railroad industry which transported his oil around the country. Standard Oil was the first great business trust in the United States. Rockefeller revolutionized the petroleum industry and, through corporate and technological innovations, was instrumental in both widely disseminating and drastically reducing the production cost of oil. His company and business practices came under criticism, particularly in the writings of author Ida Tarbell."

Dogs provide a lot of love and companionship to everyone in the family and they can be as beloved as any human.  Dogs take a great deal to care for because they are completely dependent on humans to keep them alive.  A dog left out in the wild is unlikely to survive without help from a caring human.  Dogs must be fed, watered, walked for exercise, socialized with other dogs and with other people as well so that they feel safe and interact safely with others.  Dogs can live to between 10 and 15 years old on average so they are with a family for a long time.  Dogs come in all shapes, sizes, colors, skills and are often referred to as breeds.  Breeds have different characteristics and people sometimes select a dog for the breed.  Sometimes dogs are neglected or left without a family to care for them and end up in temporary homes called animal shelters.  These shelters provide a safe haven for a dog until a suitable owner is matched.  Many of the best dogs that a family gets come from a shelter."

However middle eastern music is based on different scale systems. It has quarter notes in addition and various regions have a different number of notes in their octave system.\n\nWestern music has harmony (ie. chords) while middle eastern music does not. In middle eastern music, there is only one melodic line with rise and fall. So the purity of the melodic line and the complexity of the rhythm is what make two different songs apart.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Wheat mildew is a wheat disease that affects the ear, and is brought on by causes somewhat similar to those that cause blight, though at a more advanced period of the season. If this disorder comes on immediately after the first appearance of the ear, the straw is also affected\u2014but if the grain is nearly or fully formed, injury to the straw is less discernible. Wheat may mildew where the straw is perfectly fresh, but only rarely. A severe mildew, however, retards further grain and straw maturation and leads to death. Something akin to mildew is the gum, which, in all warm moist seasons, attaches itself to the ear, and often causes considerable damage. All these different disorders are generally accompanied by insects, and by minute parasitic vegetable growths, considered by many to be the cause of the damage. Their appearance, however, may justly be attributed to the diseased state of the plant; for wherever putrefaction takes place, either in animal or vegetable substances, the presence of these parasites will never be wanting.\n\nAnother disorder that affects wheat is brought on by excessive heat, which makes the plants suffer from malnutrition, and become sickly and feeble. In this atrophic state a kind of dust gathers on the stalks and leaves, which increases with the disease, till the plant is in a great measure worn out and exhausted. The only remedy in this case, and it is one that cannot easily be administered by the hand of man, is a plentiful supply of moisture, by which, if it is received before consumption is too far advanced, the crop is benefited in a degree proportional to the extent of nourishment received, and the stage at which the disease has arrived.\n\nSome people have recommended using blighted and mildewed wheat for seed. This, however may be hazardous. Light or defective wheat does vegetate and produce a plant, but the plant may be of poor quality and incapable of withstanding winter blasts."

        "input": "",
        "output": "A-frame can occur due to many reasons, this includes improper boot setup, for example, the cuff alignment is incorrect, or technique issues. It is best to consult an experienced boot fitter to ensure the boot is set up correctly. Once you've ensured the boot is set up correctly, it is likely a technique issue. A common cause of A-frame is a result of rotating the outside knee inside more than the inside knee, and this can happen due to wider skis or wanting to create a bigger edge angle. Ideally, we should avoid over-rotating the knee inside as this creates a weaker position and instead rely on moving the hip and upper body into the inside of the turn to create a bigger edge angle and try to keep the outside leg relatively straight.\n\nA good exercise to practice this is the T-drill, where you try to make sure your outside leg is as straight as possible and create edge angle by leaning your whole body into the turn, you'll need to shorten your inside leg by bringing your need to your chest, which will then still allow you to balance mostly on your straight downhill leg."

During an emergency or other loss of power, helicopter pilots auto-rotate.  Auto-rotation is the decoupling of the rotor system from the engines to allow upward air flow to drive the rotor system at a faster than normal rate, providing kinetic energy that can be traded to arrest the helicopter's rate of descent.  To initiate auto-rotation, the helicopter pilot flattens the pitch in the rotor system's blades, reducing drag, and allowing the upward flow of air to drive its rotation.  When the helicopter is 100-150 feet above the ground, the pilot will then aggressively increase the pitch of the rotor system's blades, temporarily increasing lift and cushioning the helicopter's landing."

The Shadow of the Wind has everything going for it: mystical Barcelona, heartwarming characters, poetic language, intriguing plot.\n\nThe language and setting of the book was amazing. Zafon is extremely talented, his words are elegant and poetic, and he paints Barcelona in a myriad of different ways: dark and gothic at night, or blissfully cheerful, or dreary gloom, all depending on the characters.\n\nI loved the cast of Shadow of the Wind. Each character was well developed and given an appropriate backstory. They bumped into each other in mysterious turns, and their interactions, like Daniel and Clara, or Daniel and Nuria, were heart wrenching.\n\nBut most of all, Zafon tells a wonderful story. I loved the parallels between Julian Carax and Daniel, and how Daniel's life becomes entangled with Julian's. It makes it feel much more like magical realism, and makes for an entertaining read."

Hinduism prescribes the eternal duties, such as honesty, refraining from injuring living beings (Ahi\u1e43s\u0101), patience, forbearance, self-restraint, virtue, and compassion, among others.[web 3] Hindu practices include worship (puja), fire rituals (homa/havan), recitations (pravachan), devotion (bhakti), chanting (japa), meditation (dhy\u0101na), sacrifice (yaj\u00f1a), charity (d\u0101na), selfless service (sev\u0101), homage to one's ancestors (\u015br\u0101ddha), family-oriented rites of passage, annual festivals, and occasional pilgrimages (yatra).

        "output": "In finance, a bond is a type of security under which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged \u2013 depending on the terms \u2013 to provide cash flow to the creditor (e.g. repay the principal (i.e. amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date as well as interest (called the coupon) over a specified amount of time).The timing and the amount of cash flow provided varies, depending on the economic value that is emphasized upon, thus giving rise to different types of bonds. The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.\n\nBonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders). As creditors, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind secured creditors, in the event of bankruptcy. Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, which is a perpetuity, that is, a bond with no maturity. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short-term commercial paper are classified as money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.\n\nThe most common forms include municipal, corporate, and government bonds. Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion-stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market. The price of a bond in the secondary market may differ substantially from the principal due to various factors in bond valuation."

By listing shares for sale on the stock exchanges that make up the stock market, companies get access to the capital they need to operate and expand their businesses without having to take on debt. In exchange for the privilege of selling stock to the public, companies are required to disclose information and give shareholders a say in how their businesses are run.\n\nInvestors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on the stock market. As companies put that money to work growing and expanding their businesses, investors reap the benefits as their shares of stock become more valuable over time, leading to capital gains. In addition, companies pay dividends to their shareholders as their profits grow.\n\nThe performances of individual stocks vary widely over time, but taken as a whole the stock market has historically rewarded investors with average annual returns of around 10%, making it one of the most reliable ways of growing your money."

Don't forget that part of life is enjoying experiences and having fun too.  Find hobbies you enjoy, and do them often.  We say this is important because it will lead to never ending happiness.  As you age you will get wiser, and it will also be important to impart wisdom on those individuals who are younger than you who still need to experience life in order to gain the same wisdom."

        "output": "Although there is reasonable overlap in what you can use gravel and downcountry bikes for, the answer her largely depends on what you plan to do the most of and if trail riding will be important for you. Gravel bikes are great for covering offroad miles more efficiently and long days in the saddle both on road or offroad. However, the lack of any meaningful suspension means that or but a small amount of time off paths and more established trails will be hard work. Downcountry bikes will enable you to go on a wider range of terrain, inlcuding the ability to do trail riding (be very careful before trying to navigate downhill trails on a gravel bike!). However, downcountry bikes are usually heavier but the full suspension and geometry makes them less efficient compared to a gravel bike."

Table salt is most commonly applied \u201cat the table\u201d when eating, however many home cooks don\u2019t tend to keep multiple types of salt on hand so they might season their food with table salt during the cooking process.  \nKosher salt is a more flaky salt and typically used either in larger quantities for brining or creating a salt crust on proteins prior to cooking.  Most professional chefs will choose Kosher salt over table salt as they prefer the texture and usability.  Table salt, being very fine-grained, is more dense than kosher salt and as such, recipes using salt should be weighed rather than using a volume measurement to ensure that a different type of salt doesn\u2019t ruin the recipe."

During this time, preheat your grill on high. \n\nAfter 20 minutes, you\u2019ll want to brush the steaks on both sides with oil and season liberally with salt and pepper, or your desired steak seasoning. \n\nOnce the steaks and grill are both ready, you\u2019ll place the steaks on the grill and cook until golden brown and slightly charred, which should take roughly 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the steaks and continue to grill for an additional 4 \u2013 5 minutes for medium-rare, which has an internal temperature of 135 degrees Fahrenheit.

        "output": "The divide and average method for computing square roots starts with a guess of the square root. For example, to compute the square root of 8, we might start with 3, since we know 9 is the square of 3. Given a guess, the method is a formula for generating the next guess. The formula states the next guess should be average of the current guess and the square (the number for which you want compute the square root) divided by the guess. Returning to our example, the next guess is (3 + 8/3)/2 = 17/6. Applying this formula repeatedly yields a guess which is closer and closer to actual square root.\n\nThe reason this works is that limit of the sequence of guesses generated by this formula is the square root. To see this, first recognize that in the limit, next guess must be equal to the current guess. The guesses get closer and closer until, after an infinite number of steps, they are the same. Using a variable X to represent the limit and applying the formula yields an equation which can be solved for X via algebra. The solution is that X must be square root."

This is where the 4WD system comes into the picture. \n\n4WD is a system that includes a transfer case that directly applies power to the rear axle, both front and rear axles and in some cases, only to the front axle. In addition, some 4WD systems include lower gear ratio options, locking hubs and lockers in the axles that force an equal amount of power to each wheel. All this taken together enables a 4WD system to enable a vehicle to navigate through deep snow, mud, over rocks and other obstacles with ease.

While the instrument is predominantly made of brass, it is classified as a woodwind instrument due to the fact that it uses a reed as a means by which sound is produced.  The saxophone is a transposing instrument that is commonly keyed in B flat and E flat, and less commonly being keyed in concert C.  There are four types of saxophones that are widely used including Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Baritone.  Two versions, namely the Sopranino and the Bass, are produced by a very few manufacturers and are far less common and rarely used in most modern music.  The instrument is used in a variety of musical genres including classical, jazz, fusion, funk, rock and roll, R&B, Hiphop, and even country music.  Well known players of the saxophone include Charlie Parker, Cannonball Adderley, John Coltrane, Stan Getz, Sonny Stitt, Gerry Mulligan, Michael Brecker, David Sanborn, Art Pepper, Maceo Parker, Dexter Gordon, Candy Dulfer, Phil Woods, Mindi Abair, Chris Potter, Josh Redman, and many, many more."

        "output": "Stars that have a higher mass than about 2.2 solar masses (the mass of our Sun) will typically collapse into black holes at the end of their life cycle when fusion has stopped and no longer pushes out against the inward pull of gravity. For stars of this mass, their inward pull of gravity is too strong to be resisted by other forces, thus their fate is to become black holes. However, stars under this limit and above the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 solar masses will end their lifecycles as neutron stars. Neutron stars are also the remnants of dead stars but since they have a smaller mass, their gravity is not enough for them to cross into becoming black holes. As the dead star compresses and becomes more and more dense, regular matter is turned into neutrons and the last force to resist the pull of gravity is called degenerate neutron pressure, which is a quantum effect that dictates that no two neutrons may be in the same quantum state. This creates an outward pressure that resists the pull of gravity and settles the star into a neutron star. If more mass is added later, from a star companion or other sources, once the star's mass crosses the limit of around 2.2 solar masses even degenerate neutron pressure isn't enough to balance gravity and the star will collapse into a black hole."

Protein purification is vital for the specification of the function, structure and interactions of the protein of interest. The purification process may separate the protein and non-protein parts of the mixture, and finally separate the desired protein from all other proteins. Ideally, to study a protein of interest, it must be separated from other components of the cell so that contaminants won't interfere in the examination of the protein of interest's structure and function. Separation of one protein from all others is typically the most laborious aspect of protein purification. Separation steps usually exploit differences in protein size, physico-chemical properties, binding affinity and biological activity. The pure result may be termed protein isolate."

Depending on what you are making and what you are looking for from a taste perspective there are several options for you to substitute eggs. \n\nSilken Tofu - If you are making a vegan scramble, quiche, or homemade vegan mayonnaise. The creamy texture can help mimic the egg\u2019s soft texture in your breakfast meals and desserts.\nUnsweetened applesauce - You can use a quarter cup of unsweetened applesauce for one egg. It adds moisture and sweetness to what you are making. The natural fruit pectin also helps bind the ingredients. It can be dense than an egg in your baking so you may need to use a teaspoon of baking powder to encourage fluffiness. \nMashed banana - This has a very distinct flavor, so only use it in recipes when you think the banana flavor will complement what you are making. This works well in pancakes, brownies, and banana bread. You can use a ripe medium mashed banana for every large egg. The starches and sugars in the banana help develop a beautiful golden brown crust. \nAquafaba - This is an ideal substitute for egg whites, giving your dessert structure. Take three tablespoons of liquid from inside your can of chickpeas and whip them to a fluffy consistency. \nFlaxseeds or Chia Seeds - This is best for recipes that don\u2019t require too many eggs. Combine one tablespoon of seeds with three tablespoons of water for every large egg. Let it sit for 20 minutes to get a slimy mixture that mimics and egg.\nBaking Soda and Vinegar - Mix a teaspoon of baking soda and a tablespoon of white vinegar together to help create the air bubbles needed in things like pancakes, cookies, and quick breads. This is ideal where two or less eggs are needed."

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the world's premier basketball league, which includes 30 teams across the United States and Canada. An example of game theory in the NBA is the \"modern NBA\", in which teams play stretch 4s (Power Forwards) and 5s (Centers) who can dribble, pass and shoot rather than simply rebound and dunk. This becomes the \"strictly dominate\" strategy as this allows the \"modern\" NBA team to shoot a higher volume of 3 pointers, which has a higher expected value per shot (40 Field Goal % times 3 = 1.2) than 2 pointers (50 Field Goal % times 2 = 1). The Golden State Warriors championship run in the 2010s with Kevin Durant and Draymond Green is a great example of this coaching and player construction strategy. Now nearly all NBA teams employ this strategy, so it is less effective (A Nash (Not Steve Nash!) Equilibrium)."

Our favorite family vacations have involved going to special natural parks, called National Parks, to hike, swim, camp, and enjoy the scenery that nature provides.  We also have visited cities with unique attractions like museums in Washington DC, or amusement parks in Gurnee Mills, IL, or football games in Seattle Washington, or skyscrapers of New York city.  We usually plan our family vacations several months in advance so we have options to visit the areas we are interested in and sleep in convenient and comfortable locations.

Pottery decorated using the technique is known as transferware or transfer ware.\n\nIt was developed in England from the 1750s on, and in the 19th century became enormously popular in England, though relatively little used in other major pottery-producing countries. The bulk of production was from the dominant Staffordshire pottery industry. America was a major market for English transfer-printed wares, whose imagery was adapted to the American market; several makers made this almost exclusively.\n\nThe technique was essential for adding complex decoration such as the Willow pattern to relatively cheap pottery. In particular, transfer printing brought the price of a matching dinner service low enough for large numbers of people to afford.\n\nApart from pottery, the technique was used on metal, and enamelled metal, and sometimes on wood and textiles. It remains used today, although mostly superseded by lithography. In the 19th century methods of transfer printing in colour were developed."

I'd been skiing and snowboarding for years. One winter I had a snowboarding accident and slid into a tree. Snowboarding requires larger turns with a bigger radius. I wasn't able to turn in time to avoid the tree. \n\nReliability - The thing about being on only a single piece of equipment is that your balance relies much more on the snow conditions. Under ideal conditions, its great to be able to snowboard and maintain control with the edge. Skiing on powder is also a dream. However, if the conditions are less than ideal, then snowboarding on ice becomes a dangerous, out of control situation. Skiing on ice is also no picnic, but at least you can stabilize and balance on your two skis. \n\nExpediency - Skiing with friends inevitably means that you are waiting for the slowest one before you can start down the mountain. I was that friend. Snowboarders have to sit down and strap in, while skiers can pretty much get right off the lift and start down the mountain immediately. This makes mixed groups of skiers and snowboarders the trickiest. So I would sometimes snowboard if I was traveling with snowboarders, and ski if I was traveling with skiers."

        "input": "",
        "output": "While this question continues to be debated by sports fans and pundits around the globe nearly every single day, usually the answer comes down to one of a handful of players: Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, LeBron James, or Bill Russell.\n\nMichael Jordan is the most common answer to this question. He won 6 championship rings, 5 MVP's and never lost an NBA Finals series. If he didn't take a two year hiatus from the NBA to play baseball, there is a good chance that he would have won 8 NBA championships in a row. Michael was a fantastic defender, and arguably the most relentless competitor that the NBA has ever seen. He was notorious for gambling on almost anything, and his iconic Air Jordan shoe is largely responsible for Nike's success as a global brand.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar was, until recently, the NBA's all time leading scorer. He played 20 seasons in the NBA, was a 19-time All-Star, 6-time MVP, and a 6-time NBA champion. He was incredibly consistent throughout his entire career, and transcended the NBA as a civil rights activist, author and even an actor.\n\nLeBron James is the greatest NBA player of this generation. He is a five-time NBA champion, four-time MVP, and recently surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the NBA's all time leading scorer. No player came in to the NBA with greater expectations, and somehow, LeBron surpassed them all. LeBron first made headlines at age 15, and many of his high school games were nationally televised. \n\nBill Russell was the ultimate teammate. In 13 seasons in the NBA he won 11 titles, all as a member of the Boston Celtics. During his last two seasons, he won the title as a Player/Coach, also becoming the first black coach to win an NBA title. Russell was a five-time MVP and 12-time NBA All Star, and is widely respected as the best defensive player of his era. He had a well-publicized rivalry with Wilt Chamberlain, but while Wilt chased stats, Bill made sure his team won. \n\nIn addition to these four, there have been many other amazing basketball players over the years, including modern stars like Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, the late Kobe Bryant, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and more. Debating who is the best player ever is part of what makes basketball so entertaining. So while most people may say that Michael Jordan is the greatest player ever, this debate will rage on for years to come as more and more stars enter the league and build their careers."

        "input": "",
        "output": "A mitochondrion is an organelle found in the cells of most eukaryotes, such as animals, plants and fungi. Mitochondria have a double membrane structure and use aerobic respiration to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used throughout the cell as a source of chemical energy. They were discovered by Albert von K\u00f6lliker in 1857  in the voluntary muscles of insects. The term mitochondrion was coined by Carl Benda in 1898. The mitochondrion is popularly nicknamed the \"powerhouse of the cell\", a phrase coined by Philip Siekevitz in a 1957 article of the same name.\n\nSome cells in some multicellular organisms lack mitochondria (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A large number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids and diplomonads, have reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures. One eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria, and one multicellular organism, Henneguya salminicola, is known to have retained mitochondrion-related organelles in association with a complete loss of their mitochondrial genome.\n\nMitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3 \u03bcm2 in cross section, but vary considerably in size and structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth. Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes. Mitochondria have been implicated in several human disorders and conditions, such as mitochondrial diseases, cardiac dysfunction, heart failure and autism.\n\nThe number of mitochondria in a cell can vary widely by organism, tissue, and cell type. A mature red blood cell has no mitochondria, whereas a liver cell can have more than 2000. The mitochondrion is composed of compartments that carry out specialized functions. These compartments or regions include the outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, cristae, and matrix.\n\nAlthough most of a eukaryotic cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has its own genome (\"mitogenome\") that is substantially similar to bacterial genomes. This finding has led to general acceptance of the endosymbiotic hypothesis - that free-living prokaryotic ancestors of modern mitochondria permanently fused with eukaryotic cells in the distant past, evolving such that modern animals, plants, fungi, and other eukaryotes are able to respire to generate cellular energy."

Houseplants are kept in containers that can retain water which can lead to root rot if not watered carefully. Some houseplants prefer the soil to dry out between waterings and many home gardeners end up watering before the soil has dried up sufficiently. Too much water in a container can lead to root rot which first can show symptoms in browning, dropping, and yellowing of leaves. Another reason for leaf discoloration is under watering as some plants prefer the soil to have a level of moisture at all times. Other reasons include too little sunlight which limits the plants ability to photosynthesize. Also, even too much sunlight can cause burned leaves."

        "input": "",
        "output": "A common swing fault in golfers is a slice which is caused when the face of the club isn't aligned properly to the swing path of the club.  What will typically happen is at the time of impact, the face is open in relation to the target (ie aimed to the right if you are a right handed golfer) and the swing path is closed in relation to the target (ie aimed to the left if you are a left handed golfer).  When there is a large difference between the path of the swing and the face of the club, the impact will generate a high degree of lateral spin on the ball causing the flight of the ball to curve away from the target.  Here are some ways to fix this swing fault:\n\n1. Grip the club with a stronger grip.  This means the v formed between your thumb and pointer finger on back hand is pointed to your rear shoulder and your opposite hand it also gripping the club more from the back.  This will help you close the face of the club at impact.\n2. Focus on keeping the face closed in the backswing.  One fault many amateurs have is the club face opens toward the sky on the backswing too far meaning that the face will need to turn more on the downswing to get to square at impact.  Creating less rotation on the backswing can help with this.  \n3. Keeping hips down and back in the downswing.  One fault that can cause inconsistent contact as well as a slice is when the hips thrust forward during the downswing causing the golfer to lift up to counter being too close to the ball which can often cause an over the top, out-to-in swing path.  Try to keep the hips back through the swing and focus on rotating the body to keep forward or lateral movement to a minimum.  \n\nA slice is a very common issue among golfers but knowing the causes and swing faults that lead to a slice can help you think about how you can improve your swing to fix it."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Okay kids, listen up. Nuclear fission is a very cool concept that gives us nuclear energy to power our homes and cities! You know how everything around us is made of little components called atoms, right? The centers of these atoms, called the nuclei, are themselves made of particles, called protons and neutrons. These particles are super tiny, hundreds of times smaller than the atoms themselves! Anyway, the particles in the nucleus are stuck firmly together, but if disturbed by a high-energy particle, the nucleus can split apart. When it does that, it releases a lot of energy as light and heat. This splitting of the nucleus is called fission.\n\nIn some materials, each nucleus that splits also releases more loose particles, typically neutrons, that can hit other atoms, and this leads to what's called a chain reaction: one atom splitting can cause others to do so, and keep releasing more energy. If left uncontrolled in a dense enough material, this leads to an atomic explosion, which is very bad. Definitely don't try that at home! In fact don't try anything else at home. But if controlled with the right amount of moderating material, this type of reaction can give rise to a continuous and cheap source of energy, as used in nuclear power plants. Some countries get most of their energy today from nuclear fission.\n\nThe craziest thing about nuclear fission is that it was only discovered and put into use starting in the 1930s. It's such a new finding, and it's totally changed the world. Science rules!"

Absolute pitch means that a note is represented as an absolute frequency, so if someone says \"A2\", that pitch can be mapped back to an exact frequency, and therefore can be reconciled among many different styles of music and instrumentation. \n\nIn contrast, much of Indian music (both classical and non-classical) uses the concept of relative pitch, which means that the musician sets a tonic note (their base note) and that pitch is the starting point for all other notes. For example, if one musician were to say that a specific pitch were \"sa\" (one of the 7 notes in the Indian music scale), another musician would not be able to reproduce that note, since they wouldn't know where the first musician set their tonic. However, this has other advantages,  because a tune is defined in terms of relative pitch and can be reproduced easily among different musicians and instruments without the worry of an absolute frequency which cannot be reached by a specific musical range."

The system uses a pooled lentiviral library of guide RNAs targeting every gene in the human or mouse genome, which can be introduced into cells using viral transduction. The guide RNAs are designed to target specific regions of the genome adjacent to the transcription start sites of each gene, allowing for specific and efficient gene activation or repression. GeneBass experiments typically involve the transduction of large numbers of cells, followed by selection or sorting of cells based on specific phenotypes of interest. High-throughput sequencing of the guide RNA library before and after selection can be used to identify genes that are essential for specific cellular processes or that are involved in disease pathways."

One is a mathematically faster way to pay off the debt; whereas, the alternative is slightly slower but is more psychologically motivating. This motivation is what helps the person reach their debt pay off goals. The following set of debts will be used as the basis for explaining each method:\n\nDebt A has a balance of $10,000 at a 4% interest rate. \nDebt B has a balance of $5,000 at a 10% interest rate.\nDebt C has a balance of $8,000 at a 24% interest rate. \n\nThe Debt Avalanche is typically the fastest and most cost effective way to pay off debt. The person makes minimum payments on all their debts and any extra goes towards the account with highest interest rate (Debt C in example above). Once that first balance is paid off, the person takes the payments from that and puts it all towards the second highest interest rate (Debt B). Repeat until all debts are paid.\n\nThe Debt Snowball is a method popularized by a personal finance expert, Dave Ramsey, in Step 2 of his 7 Baby Steps to building wealth. This method uses psychology by paying off the smallest balance first (Debt B above). The theory is that the feeling of quickly paying off a debt balance provides the motivation to stick with the program. Similar to the Debt Avalanche, the person takes the payments from Debt B and puts it towards the next smallest balance (Debt C). Repeat until all debts are paid."

        "instruction": "Give me a one line summary of the story below: \n\nA long long time ago the Queen of Odisha heard that there was a master stone sculptor who made such stunning statues of the gods that people would weep from happiness at the beauty of the statues if they saw them. One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. \"How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \n\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation. She looked at the sculptor and then nodded her assent. \"We decree that you shall build these statues in a hall set aside, into which no one shall enter until your work is complete and you proclaim that to us after opening the doors of the hall from within.\"",

        "input": "",
        "output": "As we age, our bodies undergo various changes. One of the most significant changes is the decrease in muscle mass and strength. This loss of muscle mass is known as sarcopenia and can start as early as age 30, with a more rapid decline after age 60. This may lead many people to believe that gaining muscle after 35 is impossible, but is that really the case?\nYes, it's possible to build muscle after 35\n\nThe short answer is yes, it is possible to build muscle after 35. In fact, strength training can be just as effective for older adults as it is for younger ones. It's never too late to start working on your fitness goals and building the body you want.\n\nThe benefits of building muscle after 35\n\nAs we age, building muscle becomes increasingly important for several reasons. First and foremost, it can help us maintain our independence and mobility as we age. Strong muscles can help us with everyday activities like carrying groceries or getting up from a chair. Building muscle can also help prevent injuries and falls, which can be more dangerous as we get older.\n\nAdditionally, building muscle can help improve our overall health. Muscle is more metabolically active than fat, which means it burns more calories at rest. This can help us maintain a healthy weight and lower our risk of developing chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.\n\nHow to build muscle after 35\n\nSo, how exactly do you go about building muscle after 35? The key is to focus on strength training exercises that target multiple muscle groups. Compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and bench presses are great for building overall strength and muscle mass.\nIt's also important to gradually increase the weight and intensity of your workouts over time. This will help you continue to make progress and avoid plateauing. Additionally, be sure to give your muscles time to rest and recover between workouts.\n\nFinally, proper nutrition is crucial for building muscle at any age. Make sure you're getting enough protein, as this is essential for muscle growth and repair. Aim for at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.\n\nBuilding muscle after 35 is definitely possible, and it comes with a variety of benefits. Strength training can help improve our overall health, prevent injury, and maintain our independence as we age. The key is to focus on compound exercises, gradually increase the intensity of your workouts, and make sure you're getting enough protein. So, what are you waiting for? It's time to hit the gym and start building the body you want!"

        "input": "",
        "output": "Tau is defined as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius.  Some 21st century mathematicians and physicists believe Tau is a better choice than Pi for use in science and mathematics.\n\nLike Pi, Tau is an irrational and transcendental number.  In decimal form, the value of Tau is 6.283185\u2026\n\nPart of the motivation for Tau is the observation that the number 2*Pi or 2\u03c0 occurs with surprising frequency throughout science and mathematics.  This raises the question of whether Pi is really an important number or something equal to two times Pi is actually more important.  Perhaps the implication is that Pi is exactly one half of some very important number!\n\nFurther consideration of the question leads to several compelling observations:\n\n\t- Using C/r as the key circle constant is better aligned with the way we define a circle: the set of all points a fixed distance (r) form a give point.\n\t- Radian angle measurements of fraction of a circle make much more sense when Tau is used as the base constant.  Using Pi, on quarter of a circle is Pi is Pi/2, one half is Pi, and the angle of a a full circle is 2*Pi.  With Tau, the angle measures are intuitively aligned to the fraction of a circle: a quarter circle is Tau/4, a half circle is Tau/2 and the angle of a full circle is Tau.  \n\t- Similarly, the radian zeroes, max, and min of the sin and cosine functions align to fractions of Tau in an intuitive fashion that aids, rather than confuses, understanding.\n\t- Key formulas that traditionally use Pi actually show more clear mathematical meaning when expressed using Tau.  For example, the area of a circle itself, when expressed with Tau, shows the same pattern of quadratic forms in distance fallen, spring energy, and kinetic energy.\n\t- Similarly, the tau-based formula for circular area actually confirms to the original proof by Archimedes showing that area of a circle equals the area of a triangle with base C (circumference) and height r (radius):  A = 1/2 b*h = 1/2 C*r = 1/2 (Tau*r)*r = 1/2 Tau*r^2.\n\n\nTau has seen significant adoption since it was originally proposed.  \n\nThe relationship between Tau and Pi is very simple.  Tau = 2*Pi.  Perhaps just as informative is the fact that Tau > Pi."

For example, same-sex marriage opinions in Texas have changed from unfavorable (~30%) to favorable (over 50%) over a short amount of time from 2009 to 2017. Measuring across issue domain tells us that knowing what an individual thinks about one issue doesn\u2019t really tell you much about what they think of another issue.\nLevels of conceptualization are used to categorize people by use of ideological language in explaining their opinions.  There are five levels, the first is \u201cideologues\u201d, when people rely on abstract concepts to make judgements about political objects.  Second, are \u201cnear-ideologues\u201d who use ideological terminology, but don\u2019t always use it correctly.  Third, are \u201cgroup interest\u201d, where people evaluate political objects with respect to their treatment of particular groups.

When using such finely grained flour go for a 65% hydration dough, 3% salt, and 0.5% dry yeast. This means for every 1000 parts flour, put 650 parts water.\n\nGreat pizza dough takes time to ferment. There are few ways to do it but the easiest one for the home is to pre-ferment a small portion of equal amounts of water and flour.\n\nFor example, start with separating out the total ingredients: 1000g flour, 650g water, 30g salt, 5g dry yeast. This will result in 1680g of dough enough for ~8 medium pizzas. Mix 200g of water, flour and the yeast and let it sit on counter for an hour. Then move to the refrigerator for slow fermentation for ~24h. Take this out and add the remaining ingredients. Kneed until smooth, and let it rest on the counter for 1h. Cover with olive oil to avoid drying out. Cut balls and place in a tray. Lightly cover with olive oil again and cling film.

Generally it is recommended to keep an emergency fund available in savings accounts as they may need to be quickly accessible. \n\nThe stock market works differently - you are purchasing shares of a company, and ideally that company grows over time, thus increasing the value of the underlying stocks. People generally invest in the stock market in order to grow their money over time, although it is recommended to measure the success or failure of investments over a long time period (greater than 10 years).

The problem with this method is that Trump was then able to revoke those acts, undoing all the work that Obama accomplished.  The second is bi-partisan support for Presidential programs.  If both sides take ownership of an issue, it tends to make it easier to enact policy.  Third, the President needs to be able to compromise.  If he can\u2019t compromise, he won\u2019t be able to effectively negotiate a bill with Congress.  Fourth is the President needs a sound program.

        "output": "Baseball is a game that is played between two teams. The playing field is shaped like a diamond made up by four \"bases\" plus a pitching mound. Each team needs at least 9 players to occupy all field positions. Those positions are Catcher, Pitcher, First base, Second base, short stop, third base, left field, center field, and right field. The point of the game is to score more \"Runs\" than the other team. Each team takes turns trying to hit a ball pitched to them by the opposing teams pitcher. If you hit the ball you run in order from first base to second to third and then home. Once the ball is hit the other team can tag you out with the ball that you hit. Each base is a safe spot to stand so you can stop at any base and let the next person on your team try to hit the ball and advance you to the next base. If you are tagged out then your team has an out. You get three outs in an inning. Once there are three outs you switch from hitting to pitching with the other team. When you are batting you get three strikes and four balls. If the pitcher throws four balls then you can walk to first base. This is called a walk. If you swing and miss the ball, that is called a strike. You can also strike out by not swinging at a pitch that is in an imaginary strike zone. This zone is there to give the pitcher something to aim and the hitter a reasonable area to hit a ball. There are 8 innings in a game. After 8 turns being up to bat the team with more runs wins. The home team always hits last. There are lots of nuanced rules and it is most popular in the country that created it, the United States of America."

Humans that best align with this organizing force or God are guaranteed good fortune in this life or after.  There are variations in humans level of involvement in this process with Christianity requiring a savior (Jesus) for people to enter the afterlife vs achieving a higher state of consciousness in this life or through reincarnation.\n\nPhilosophers differ on the meaning of life with predominate views following down the lines of seeking your own fulfillment or the fulfillment of others.  Seeking your own fulfillment has been a major component of capitalism, self-preservation, and risk taking that lead to new discoveries in Science and Technology.  Seeking the fulfillment of others has lead to great advancements in philanthropy, equality, and the general well being of society.  This \"social compact\" insures stability and provides an expectation that harmful activities like Murder, Robbery, etc are discouraged and punished.\n\nScientists view this question through the lens of the observable universe.  As such efforts have been made to create a \"unifying theory of everything\" to show some understandable order to the universe.  Others have focused their study on the improbability of how humans could have been created in a universe with seemingly random and infinite chance.  Some scientists have conceded that the question is something Science is ill-fitted to answer.\n\nMost importantly Douglas Adams, a prominent British author specializing in absurdity, answered the question in the book \"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\" with the answer \"42.\""

A warmed Snuggle Safe disk at the opening of the cage or crate is a good idea. 2) Provide kittens with adequate nutrition. Kittens should gain about \u00bd ounce (14 grams) per day or 4 ounces (113 grams) per week. When feeding,  The temperature of the formula before feeding should be warm to around 100oF or 38oC, but not too hot.3) Keep kittens clean. If kittens are orphaned and do not have a mom to regularly groom then, it is important to teach them to groom and keep them clean. It is okay to wash a kitten with warm water but focus only on the areas needing cleaned.4) Provide socialisation with people and with other kittens. It is good to get them used to contact with people when they're 3 weeks old. They could learn from their littermates and learning from their mom.

The CPU can have multiple processing cores and is commonly referred to as the brain of the computer. It is essential to all modern computing systems as it executes the commands and processes needed for your computer and operating system. The CPU is also important in determining how fast programs can run, from surfing the web to building spreadsheets. The GPU is a processor that is made up of many smaller and more specialized cores. By working together, the cores deliver massive performance when a processing task can be divided up and processed across many cores.\n\nWhile CPUs and GPUs have a lot in common - Both are critical computing engines. Both are silicon-based microprocessors. And both handle data - they do have different architectures and are built for different purposes.\n\nThe CPU is suited to a wide variety of workloads, especially those for which latency or per-core performance are important. A powerful execution engine, the CPU focuses its smaller number of cores on individual tasks and on getting things done quickly. This makes it uniquely well equipped for jobs ranging from serial computing to running databases.\n\nGPUs began as specialized ASICs developed to accelerate specific 3D rendering tasks. Over time, these fixed-function engines became more programmable and more flexible. While graphics and the increasingly lifelike visuals of today\u2019s top games remain their principal function, GPUs have evolved to become more general-purpose parallel processors as well, handling a growing range of applications."

        "input": "",
        "output": "There are a series of factors when considering to purchase a tennis racquets.  Primary factors include head size, length, weight, stiffness, and swingweight  \n\nHead size - Power is closely correlated to head size - the larger the head size, the more power can be generated, all other factors being equal.  A larger head size also provides larger hitting area and 'sweetspot'.  Smaller head sizes tend to equate to more control and maneuverability. \n\nLength - The standard length is a 27 inches, but can range from 26.5 inches to 29 inches.  A longer racquets provides more reach and often results in more power.  Similar to head size, longer racquets may limit maneuverability and control. \n\nWeight - The heavier the racquet, the more power you will generate (increasing the 'swingweight') of the racquet.  The lighter the racquet, the more maneuverable and easier it will be for players to get the racket to the right swing position.  The balance of the racquet is also critical as part of weight.  A more head light racket (more weight in the handle) provides increased maneuverability, especially when using a heavier racquet. A more balanced or head heavy racket are often reserved for lighter racquets to maintain the mass behind the ball\n\nStiffness - Generally speaking, the stiffer the racket, the less energy is lost as the ball is redirected with your racquet and thus, creating more power.  More flexible racquets allow for more feel and control.  Flexible racquets provide more comfort as less shock and impact is transferred to the arm and elbow.\n\nSwingweight - Swingweight measures how heavy a racquet feels when you swing it and the amount of power you can transfer to the ball.  Higher swingweight will also provide more stability in the racquet but will sacrifice maneuverability."

If the retired couple plans on staying in one place then a travel trailer may be a better option as it can be set up and left at the campground, allowing the owners to use their car or truck to make day trips.

Music theory is, essentially, what musicians have learned over the course of several hundred years about how to write music that is interesting and sounds good. In other words, music theory is there to help you, not hold you back. \n\nWhen you learn music theory, what often happens is that you expand your broader understanding of music, which can be a very helpful safety net. The more music theory you know, the easier you\u2019ll be able to distinguish between the good ideas and the not-so-good. You need to know the rules before you can break them. You need to be able to write by the book before you throw the book away. If not, you run the risk of writing music that\u2019s not nearly as clever as you think it is, that tries to be daring and experimental but ends up just being dull and vanilla. And frankly, I just don\u2019t see the value in ignoring all the work that centuries worth of musicians have done into knowing how music works. Putting the time into learning and really understanding it can only make you a better musician and a better composer.\n\nSo, that\u2019s my answer.

Use a drumstick to tap around the drum by each tension rod and listen for a consistent sound. \n\nOnce you have the overall sound in the range you\u2019re looking for, test the pitch by tapping around the drum. For the snare\u2019s resonant head, detune it like the batter head. Tune it \u2018tabletop tight\u2019: so flat you could confidently rest a drink on it (don\u2019t do this, though).

This resulted in numerous riots and protests throughout the Soviet Union with demands for independence and national self-determination. \n\nEconomic stagnation and fall of oil prices:  The centrally planned economic model resulted in massive shortages of staple consumer products.  Shops were continually empty and Soviet citizens needed to wait in long lines to purchase basic goods.  After years of economic deprivation, Soviet citizens were deeply angry at their government. In addition, oil prices declined significantly in the late 1980s, which provided the Soviet government a key source of hard currency.  This it made it difficult for the Soviet government to sustain high levels of military spending and keep the economy functioning. \n\nPerestroika and Glasnost: Gorbachev's reforms of the 1980s were intended to reinvigorate the Soviet economy.  However, they unintentionally triggered an opening of debate throughout the country.  The increased freedoms allowed people to more openly criticize the government and demand changes.  \n\nAfghanistan and Chernobyl: In the late 1980s, two events symbolized the incompetence of the Soviet government.  The failure of the Afghanistan war resulted in a loss of confidence in the Soviet military. The Chernobyl disaster revealed the incompetence and duplicity of the Soviet regime, resulting in a further erosion of trust."

This allows us to confirm that the various objects in the universe are moving away from us and from one another. The faster a galaxy moves away from the observer, the further it is from the observer. This phenomenon is interpreted as proof of the universe's expansion and the Big Bang."

Some people will start a relationship with friends after knowing each other for years, while some will love someone who was still a completely stranger yesterday. Some people will completely rely on serendipity to meet someone new, while some use dating apps to find a potential lover with clear purposes. There are no right ways to start a relationship, but a wrong relationship can be harmful to both sides. Therefore, you should take your take and never rush into a new relationship. Some tips for finding a BF or GF:\n1. Participate in more events to meet new people. For example, exercise classes, clubs of your hobby, volunteering, and parties can be a good start.\n2. Ask your friends to recommend some guy/girl they know. Friends can be a reliable source since they share similar background and experience with you.\n3. Be nice, honest and helpful to everyone you meet. This can help you to build good reputation in your friends circle so that people are more likely to be attracted by you.\n4. Know a person well before you start developing a romantic relationship with him/her. Some people may be very different as a friend vs. in a relationship. It's better to spend more time dating, knowing his/her life before making a decision."

Some techniques prefer breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth, although this is not required. One way to narrow your attention is to closely observe the sensation of cool air as it passes over the tip of your nose, and the sensation of your chest falling as you exhale. Allow any rising thoughts to pass through your mind without paying attention to them, or engaging with them.\n\nOther techniques involve focusing your attention to sensations in your body like hot and cold, or pain. You can also bring your focus to feelings like fear, anxiety, or love - focus your attention on where exactly in the body you feel those feelings. You can also move your attention to external stimulus like sounds, and your visual field.\n\nMindfulness is an extremely powerful technique that anyone can do from anywhere. Good luck practicing!"

You'll soak up a lot just taking the time to really observe.  Second, check-out where the other surfers are entering and where they are swimming out to.  Obvious, I know, but surprisingly people will sometimes skip this step.  Third, see if you can figure out where the channels are - he channel is where the waves are breaking towards.  If you see two waves coming toward the shore in synchronization with each other, but separated by a patch of calmer water in between - the channel is typically below that calmer water."

Currently, all games are held at the Eisstadion Davos.\n\nIt was originally devised by Dr. Carl Spengler as a means to promote teams from German-speaking Europe, who might have suffered ostracism in the aftermath of World War I. Eventually, the tournament grew well beyond expectations. Many of Europe's most prestigious clubs and national programs have appeared, including Soviet, Czechoslovak, Swedish, German, and Finnish powerhouses. Through its history, club or national teams from 13 countries have won the tournament, with Team Canada winning the most cups as a club (16) while various teams from Switzerland have won the most cups for one country (20).\n\nAmong non-European organizations, Team Canada, Team USA, nationally ranked U.S. collegiate teams, reigning AHL Calder Cup and Ontario Hockey Association champions, and even Team Japan (in 1971, building international experience before playing as hosts of the 1972 Sapporo Winter Olympics) have competed for the Spengler Cup. Since at least 1990, Team Canada has been the only participant from North America, with the exception of the AHL's Rochester Americans in 1996 and 2013 (see AHL participation at the Spengler Cup).\n\nIn the 2018 tournament, Finnish club team KalPa from the city of Kuopio defeated Team Canada 2\u20131 in the final.

Candidates should look for jobs that involve building best-in-class business skills (such as working at Goldman Sachs or McKinsey) or involve leading large groups of people to accomplish important and challenging projects.  One piece of advice is to look at the resumes of successful applicants and see what types of roles they had pre-MBA.\n\nIn addition to having excellent work experience on your resume, it is equally important to have a track record of success at those jobs.  To evaluate track record of strong work performance, business schools require 2-3 letters of recommendations.  It is critical for these recommendations to be highly positive, and any lack of enthusiasm can be an instant red flag for admissions officers.\n\nIn terms of quantitative factors, Harvard, Stanford and Wharton have high average GMAT scores.  Harvard's median GMAT score, for example, was 730 out of 800 for the class of 2024.  Be sure to invest time in preparing for the GMAT, as candidates can significantly increase scores through consistent and dedicated practice.\n\nAdditionally, the essays candidates submit are very important.  The goal of a business school admissions officer to is find candidates who are likely to reach senior executive leadership or other impactful roles in society.  Your essay would ideally reflect a) an aspirational but attainable goal to reach a high impact position, and b) a clear path to get from where you currently are to your long-term goals, including a logical short-term goal immediate post-business school.\n\nSome candidates opt to hire an MBA admissions consultant, which typically costs between $2000-3000 per application.

At a high level, this can be split into two sections: \n    - Striking: Relevant marital arts you may want to consider training is Boxing, Kickboxing, Muai-Thai. \n    - Grappling: Relevant marital arts you may want to consider training in is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Sambo, Freestyle Wresting. \n\n3) Consider specializing: While it is good to have a breadth of different techniques, really honing in on one sub-discipline can give you an edge in comparison to other fighters.

This kind of natural breakdown is natural and needed for muscle growth, since muscle grows back stronger during the body's repair process. During this process the affected muscle fibers increase in strength and thickness. \n\nAdditionally, people tend to experience lactic acid buildup prior to exercise as your body uses oxygen to convert glucose to energy. During exercise, if there is a lack of oxygen for this process, you may produce a substance called lactate. Many people believe that soreness comes from the buildup of this lactic acid, but the real contributor is the breakdown of muscle from usage."

Tretinoin can also be called all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA).\n\nWhen it comes to treating your skin, the biggest difference between these two compounds is their strength.\n\nRetinol is a vital nutrient. It\u2019s fat-soluble, which means it can stay in your body for a long time. Your liver can take this stored retinol and convert it into tretinoin. Your body will use the tretinoin for a variety of biological functions.\n\nFor the purposes of skin care, tretinoin can be thought of as a more concentrated version of retinol.

Each kid needs to have their own properly installed car seat and you\u2019ll likely need to have enough room for strollers, diaper bags, and other gear. Some mid-size sedans and small SUVs can fit 3 car seats across the back row, but to fit them safely, you\u2019ll need to find the right set of thin car seats the meet the size requirements of your children (e.g. height and weight). For example, Clek makes narrow car seats. That said, taking a trip with 3 kids in these mid-size cars will be challenging unless you add a luggage rack to the top of your car. \n\nMid-size SUVs like the Honda Pilot, Kia Telluride, and the Toyota Highlander can accommodate wider car seats in their second row and even include a third row. That said, the third row is difficult to access when car seats are installed in the second row and there isn\u2019t much luggage space when the third row is used for seating.\n\nAll that considered, your best bet for 3 kids and lots of gear is a minivan or full size SUV (Chevy Suburban, GMC Yukon XL, Toyota Sequoia).

On the other hand, an advantage of RSUs is that they always have a nonzero value, whereas a stock option can become worthless if the stock price declines below the strike price."

After his grand slam in 1930, Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co-designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie. First played 89 years ago in 1934, the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless they need to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Lee Elder, and Tom Watson. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Tiger Woods won five between 1997 and 2019. Palmer won four between 1958 and 1964. Five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson. Player, from South Africa, was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in 1961; the second was Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the champion in 1980 and 1983.\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened 90 years ago in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed."

Some key advantages are the ability to develop closer personal relationships with team members, have the opportunity for more spontaneous casual conversations, and experience more productive meetings because of the ability to read people's body language and to see presentation materials more clearly. Many people will experience better mental health by going into the office and establishing a sense of greater connection with team members. In addition, certain employees will take advantage of remote work to use work time to engage in personal activities rather than real work, to the detriment of the employer. Some disadvantages of going into the office include the time inefficiency from commuting, the cost of commuting, the time inefficiency that occurs from experiencing all the social chatting that occurs in the office, and the hassle of having to schedule conference rooms. Commuting also contributes to global warming through the greater use of fossil fuels. On balance, whether remote work makes sense is a complex question, and the answer will be unique for every employee and employer depending on the circumstances."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Brazilian Jiujitsu, or BJJ, is known as the gentle art in martial arts.  BJJ can be practiced in two modalities: Sport BJJ and the other as self defense. Sport BJJ is competitive and based on a point system based on a competitor being awarded a number of points based on advancing to a more advantageous position. Alternatively, a competitor may immediately win the match by submission. When BJJ is used in self defense, the goal is usually to subdue an attacker.  Since BJJ is mostly grappling from the ground, it can be a highly effective practice for self defense as many street fights end up on the ground. While many of the techniques are intended to immobilize an opponent, it can be less effective if the opponent has an unfair advantage such as the use of a weapon. Practicing BJJ routinely will prepare the practitioner mentally for physical combat which can be advantageous in a self defense scenario. Another reason BJJ can be viewed as good for self defense is that there are techniques that can work well for different body types that level the playing field for even smaller or weaker opponents. If both opponents are trained in BJJ, size and strength can become a larger factor.  Routine training can also lead to increased physical fitness as classes can be quite rigorous and physically demanding. Some may argue that more ruthless martial arts are intentionally designed for self defense and therefore may be more effective."

At the same time, the index needs to be kept up-to-date with the table, which means that each table update (insertion or deletion of new rows, or updates to existing rows for the columns that the index covers) will now cost more as the relational database system has to also propagate the update to the index.

        "output": "The American Film Institute and the British Film Institute have Citizen Kane listed as the number one movie of all time.  The British Film Institute has had this rating of Citizen Kane for 50 years.  There are multitudes of reasons why this is a deserving title with a few examples below.\n\n1. Citizen Kane was a thinly veiled movie about a powerful person.  Even before the movie was released newspaper magnate William R Hearst became aware that Kane had many similarities to Hearst.  Both controlled media empires, ran for office, and had giant mansions filled with odds and ends.  Where it allegedly became personal was when scenes showing Kane's wife put through an humiliating run in showbiz propped up by Kane's largesse mirrored Hearst a bit too closely to real life.  Hearst reportedly offered to buy all copies of the film and told newspapers to not print anything or even mention its name.\n\n2. It heralded a new age of cinematography in 1941.  Citizen Kane pioneered in the mainstream many types of compositions and angles we now find quite common.  For a low angle shot in an office to show Kane's towering presence film cameras were too heavy and bulky to sit on the floor.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland solved this by having a hole dug deep enough for camera and tripod to achieve the desired effect.  Also the concept of \"deep focus\" or achieving a large depth of field to make characters near and far appear sharp is difficult to achieve.  These scenes were used to great effect to portray Kane as being surrounded and alone with his wealth later in the movie.  They also provided a literal window into a young innocent Kane during a tense scene inside the house, to which Kane was blissfully unaware but the audience experienced both to jarring effect.\n\n3. Orson Welles was famous and an excellent promoter.  Up to this point Welles most famous exploit had been his radio re-enactment of H.G. Wells \"War of the Worlds.\"  Choosing to follow a newsreel style format and not having an intro saying this is a work of fiction many listeners at home were swept up in the drama and thought an alien invasion was happening.  His popularity from this event carried a great deal of interest over to his first film.  For his first film to come together with a compelling story, technical wizardry, and cultural relevancy truly made it the standard for what a \"Best Film...\" should be.\n\nAs a sidenote in 1921 Citizen Kane won 9 Academy awards including Best Picture, Director, Editing, and Cinematography. Orson Welles would never have a similar level of success with his later films."

During times when the economy is doing incredibly well, a.k.a. running hot or facing inflation (rise of prices of goods and services), the Federal Reserve will need to reduce the supply of money by increasing the cost of borrowing.  \n\nThe primary lever to increase the cost of borrowing is by increasing the Federal Funds rate (the rate for banks to borrow and lend their excess reserves to meet liquidity requirements). Increasing the Federal Funds rate results in more expensive borrowing costs, which can reduce demand among banks to borrow money.  Less money is borrowed to help fund the economy resulting in a reduction in purchasing power and the money supply.  This will slow down the pace of economic growth and help ease inflation."

        "output": "An allele is a variation of the same sequence of nucleotides at the same place on a long DNA molecule, as described in leading textbooks on genetics and evolution.\n\nThe word \"Allele\" is a short form of \"allelomorph\".\n\n\"The chromosomal or genomic location of a gene or any other genetic element is called a locus (plural: loci) and alternative DNA sequences at a locus are called alleles.\"\n\nThe simplest alleles are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), but they can also be insertions and deletions of up to several thousand base pairs.\n\nPopular definitions of 'allele' typically refer only to different alleles within genes. For example, the ABO blood grouping is controlled by the ABO gene, which has six common alleles (variants). In population genetics, nearly every living human's phenotype for the ABO gene is some combination of just these six alleles.\n\nMost alleles observed result in little or no change in the function of the gene product it codes for. However, sometimes, different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic traits, such as different pigmentation. A notable example of this is Gregor Mendel's discovery that the white and purple flower colors in pea plants were the result of a single gene with two alleles.\n\nNearly all multicellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes at some point in their biological life cycle; that is, they are diploid. In this case, the chromosomes can be paired. Each chromosome in the pair contains the same genes in the same order, and place, along the length of the chromosome. For a given gene, if the two chromosomes contain the same allele, they, and the organism, are homozygous with respect to that gene. If the alleles are different, they, and the organism, are heterozygous with respect to that gene."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Some believe that continuous optimisation problems might be easier to solve than their discrete counterparts, owing to the smoothness of the objective functions, which allows the use of calculus techniques. In general, calculus techniques mean to use objective and constraint information at a particular point x, to deduce information about the behaviour of the objective function at all surrounding points close to x. The deduced information is then used to guide the search direction. In contrast, combinatorial optimisation problems are to some extent harder to solve than continuous ones. This is because the behaviour of the objective and constraints may change significantly as we move from one feasible point to another, even if the two points are close according to some measure. Thus it is usually not possible to deduce information about the neighbouring points from the current one."

Being able to create shelter in adverse weather is also necessary, as humans exposed to harsh elements to extended periods have a smaller chance of survival. Since food and water are also paramount to survival, understanding your best chances on locating water that is safe to drink or that can be purified using natural resources is a skill set most would consider critical; almost equally, knowing what in nature is edible for foraging will help fuel someone. An example is being able to identify which mushrooms or berries are safe versus toxic.

So if a customer suddenly asks for their deposits back, the bank can\u2019t immediately sell its investments to give it to them. To counter this, banks keep a pool of money on hand to handle day to day deposits and withdrawals.\n\nHowever, if every customer wants to withdraw their deposits at once, the bank does not have enough money to give to every customer.

        "input": "",

It is typically staffed by nurse practitioners or physician assistants, and may be affiliated with a larger medical institution. Minute clinics are often located in retail stores, like pharmacies or supermarkets.\nA pharmacy, on the other hand, is a place where medications are dispensed and can also offer vaccination services. Many pharmacies have pharmacists who are trained to administer vaccines.\n\nFees:\nBoth clinics and pharmacies may charge a fee for administering a vaccine, but these fees can vary. In general, the vaccine fee covers the cost of the vaccine itself, while the visit fee or administration fee covers the cost of having a healthcare professional administer the vaccine.\nWhen it comes to health insurance coverage, many plans cover preventive procedures like vaccines at 100%. However, the coverage of visit fees or administration fees can vary depending on your insurance plan and the location where you receive the vaccine.\n\nTo avoid unexpected charges, it's important to verify the following information:\n\nCheck with your insurance provider to confirm what is covered and if there are any out-of-pocket expenses.\nInquire about potential fees at the clinic or pharmacy before scheduling your vaccine appointment. This includes asking about both the vaccine fee and any visit or administration fees.\nUltimately, whether you choose to get a vaccine at a clinic or a pharmacy, it's essential to understand the potential fees involved and how your insurance coverage applies to those fees."

        "output": "In biochemistry and metabolism, beta oxidation (also \u03b2-oxidation) is the catabolic process by which fatty acid molecules are broken down in the cytosol in prokaryotes and in the mitochondria in eukaryotes to generate acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle, and NADH and FADH2, which are co-enzymes used in the electron transport chain. It is named as such because the beta carbon of the fatty acid undergoes oxidation to a carbonyl group. Beta-oxidation is primarily facilitated by the mitochondrial trifunctional protein, an enzyme complex associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane, although very long chain fatty acids are oxidized in peroxisomes."

Due to this reflex issue, as soon as we put him in the bed, he wakes up immediately and started to cry as the milk comes up from his stomach to his mouth. We are at-least a bit lucky here as he sleeps on our hands. Some babies may have colic and cries with no reason. That would have been much worse situation to be in.\n* You might be wondering how to hold the baby properly and how to change diapers and so on and forth. Trust me, you will learn all these things in no time.\n* Babies mainly cries for the following three reasons. 1. When they are hungry 2. When they are sleepy 3. When they need diaper change. Hence you should rule out all these three before you escalate the baby crying issue.\n* Team work is very important. Work with your partner. Plan, schedule your time and execute it. Taking care of baby is really a two or more persons job. Your partner needs all the help that is available. Utilise your parental leave.\n* Don\u2019t get stressed out if the baby do not reach the milestones that you read on the internet. Every baby is unique and they reach milestones in their own timeline\n* It is very important to enjoy the journey as you will never get those moments back and trust me, these will be very precious moment in your life."

An octane number such as 87, 91, 93 indicates the amount of heat tolerance of the fuel before igniting inside the engine cylinder. The higher the octane number, the higher heat tolerance. If you use the wrong octane in a vehicle, such as using 87, rather than 93 for a high performing turbo or supercharged vehicle, the engine could produce knock or pre-detonation. Knock occurs when the timing of of the air and fuel mixture in the cylinder explodes too early and can cause serious damage to the engine components. Knock is also something you can hear and feel and can be noticed by the driver. Having the detonation of the air and fuel, produced by the spark plug that is intended from the factory is optimal for the longevity of the vehicle."

Graduation being his first stadium album that really skyrocketed Kanye into the mainstream resulting in sold out tours and solidifying pop culture relevance.

There are many different reasons that people decide to pursue getting their pilot's license including the challenge of learning a new skill, having the ability to travel by private plane for business or pleasure, sightseeing, or as a career option.  The process of learning to fly and getting your license requires several steps and usually takes about a year to complete.  The first step is to research local flight schools and potentially do a discovery flight with a flight instructor to see if you enjoy it before committing the time and money.  Should you decide to pursue it, you'll need to find and go to an Aviation Medical Examiner to get checked-out and have a student pilot and medical certificate issued.  Once you've completed that you can begin your training which will include both ground school and flight school.  The next step is to purchase the necessary books, study sufficiently and prepare to take an FAA written exam.  While you're studying, you'll begin your flight training which requires a minimum of 40 hours of flying, however most individuals end-up flying between 60 - 75 hours.  When your instructor feels you're able to demonstrate mastery of all of the required skills and are able to make sound decisions, you'll be ready to take a practical exam with either an FAA examiner or a designated examiner.   Upon successful completion of your test, you'll be issued your pilots license and be ready to take up passengers.  On average, the cost to get your pilot's license ranges from $8,000 to $12,000.  This may sound expensive, but it's worth it to have a skill that you can enjoy for a lifetime."

        "output": "Tides are very long waves moving across the ocean and are caused by the gravitational forces exerted on the earth by the moon. When the highest point in the long-period wave reaches a shoreline the area experiences high tide. When the lowest point of the wave, the trough, reaches shore the area experiences low tide. The earth is mostly water and the water \"points\" at the moon, the parts of the Earth experiencing high tide is the water drawing towards the moon. The \"pointing\" water that faces the moon is formed because the gravitational pull of the moon is strongest on whichever side of the Earth faces it. Gravity pulls the ocean towards the moon and high tide occurs.\n\nThe bulge on the far side of the Earth is caused by inertia. The water moving away from the moon resists the gravitational forces that attempt to pull it in the opposite direction. Because the gravitational pull of the moon is weaker on the far side of the Earth, inertia wins, the ocean bulges out and high tide occurs. As the Earth spins, different areas of the planet face the moon, and this rotation causes the tides to cycle around the planet."

To eat crawfish, sometimes called crawdads or mudbugs, you first need to purchase them.  Crawfish are usually sold by the sack with typical weights around 30-40 pounds.  You must then clean the crawfish as their natural habitats are within mud, swamps, and muck.   Rinsing them thoroughly in water is required.  Many will do this a sack at a time and continue to rinse until the water is crystal clear noting that they're clean.  Others go a step further through a process of purging.  This is using salt to have the crawfish clean out its insides.  Many think purging is a myth and simply skip this step.  Once clean, you'll want to bring a large pot (typically 80+ quarts in size) of water to a rolling boil.  Add in spices to flavor the water.  There are also pre-made bags of spice known as 'boil.'  Boil the crawfish until they float to the top and turn bright red.  Then allow the crawfish to soak to absorb the added spice.  This process can last as long as an hour or more, though 30 minutes is fairly typical.  Many people will add potatoes, corn, onions, and other sides to their boil.  Learning to peel a crawfish is an art, but can be quickly done by twisting off the tail.  Peel the rest of the shell off and eat the tail.  Many will also suck the head to get a burst of flavor."

Making the soil ready and adding some plant food at regular intervals is required to keep the produce at good numbers. The owner will have health benefits of stress free time during the time they work on the garden and when they see the produce on the dinner table in the form of a delicious dish. Owners have a great time posting their produce pictures and dishes to social media to share with friends. Each year they plan 3 to 4 months in advance on the kind of plants that they would like to plant in the garden. They work with friends to find the seeds for various plants that they like to plant as well as share tips to keep the garden healthy.

The away goal rule was a tie breaker in case the winner of the fixture in the knock-out stage could not be determined after adding up scores from both games. In case there is a  tie when you add up the scores of both games, the team that scored more away goals would advance to the next round of the competition. For example, if Team A lost the first game 2:1 playing away and won the second game with the score of 1:0 at home, the aggregate score of those two games is 2:2 (a tie), but since Team A scored 1 goal playing away and Team B scored 0 away goals, Team A would advance the next round."

Some sufferers report impairment to vision either before or during the headache, described as an aura effect, and as such extreme sensitivity to light can be a common symptom.\n\nThe causes of migraine headaches are harder to define, and harder as a result to treat. Most medical professionals agree that the causes of migraines are unknown, however there are a number of triggers that can set off a migraine in sufferers. These include dietary triggers such as dehydration, coffee, alcohol and many others. Hormonal changes can also be a trigger, so many women are impacted during their menstrual cycle. Other triggers such as stress and emotional anguish can also cause the onset of migraines. Environmental factors such as bright or flickering lights can also be a trigger.\n\nFor most sufferers, rest and non-prescription painkillers such as ibuprofen are sufficient to recover from a headache, but more extreme cases may require a visit to a GP and prescription of triptans to alleviate the symptoms. Other treatments include acupuncture and transcranial stimulation, but ideally understanding and avoiding personal trigger factors is the preferred method."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The reason behind Columbus' belief that he had reached Asia is depicted on a map of the Atlantic Ocean from 1474, created by Florentine mathematician, astronomer, and cosmographer Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli. This map was later included in a literary and historical atlas of America by Bartholomew in 1884, with light blue areas marking regions that were not originally present on the map.\n\nToscanelli served as an inspiration for Columbus, who received a letter from him on June 25, 1474. The letter was sent to canon Fernam Martins in Lisbon, who consulted Toscanelli on behalf of King Alfonso V about the possibility of reaching India through a western route.\n\nThe map clearly shows that Columbus was both inspired and misguided by Toscanelli's plan, which underestimated the Earth's circumference. This miscalculation led Columbus to believe that he had reached Japan instead of a completely new and unfamiliar continent lying between Europe and Asia.\n\nToscanelli's proposed plan involved sailing west along the equator to reach India and the wealthy countries of East Asia. The map that Toscanelli enclosed, which is now lost, included the western fringes of Europe and Africa, as well as the eastern fringes of Asia, with the Atlantic Ocean in between. However, Toscanelli mistakenly believed that the distance was only one-third of the Earth's circumference, far less than the actual distance.\n\nIn a letter, Toscanelli writes, among other things:\n\nI have already spoken once before of a route across the sea to the land of spices, much shorter than that of the Portuguese across Guinea. That is why His Highness the King is now asking me for information on this subject, or rather for an explanation so clear that even people without any scientific background can understand that this path must exist. Although I know that it has its basis in the spherical shape of the earth, I have nevertheless, in order to make myself better understood and facilitate the project, decided to prove that such a route exists by means of a specially constructed sea chart. I am therefore sending his highness a map drawn by myself, on which I have marked the coasts and islands which can be used as points of departure when one undertakes such a journey and on this journey keeps a steady westerly course"

        "input": "",
        "output": "When it comes to buying a car, there are two main options: buying a new car or buying a used car. While both options have their advantages and disadvantages, many people wonder if it is better to buy a used car compared to a new car. In this article, we will explore the pros and cons of buying a used car and help you decide if it is the right choice for you.\n\nPros of Buying a Used Car\n\n1. Lower Price\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of buying a used car is the lower price. Used cars are typically much cheaper than new cars, even if they are only a few years old. This is because new cars lose value quickly as soon as they are driven off the dealership lot. By buying a used car, you can often get a great deal and save thousands of dollars.\n\n2. Lower Depreciation\n\nNew cars depreciate quickly in the first few years of ownership, often losing up to 50% of their value. Used cars, on the other hand, have already gone through this initial depreciation period, so they lose value at a much slower rate. This means that if you decide to sell your used car in a few years, you may not lose as much money as you would with a new car.\n\n3. Lower Insurance Costs\n\nInsurance costs for a used car are typically lower than for a new car. This is because used cars are less expensive, so the insurance company does not have to pay out as much if the car is damaged or totaled. Additionally, if you own the car outright, you may be able to choose a lower level of insurance coverage, which can further reduce your insurance costs.\n\n4. More Options\n\nWhen you buy a used car, you have a wider range of options to choose from than if you were buying a new car. You can choose from different makes, models, and years, and you may be able to find a car with features that are no longer available on new cars. This means that you can find a car that fits your specific needs and preferences.\n\n5. No Hidden Fees\n\nWhen you buy a new car, you may be charged various fees and expenses, such as a destination fee, dealer preparation fee, and advertising fee. With a used car, you do not have to worry about these hidden fees, as they have already been paid by the previous owner.\n\nCons of Buying a Used Car\n\n1. Higher Maintenance Costs\n\nUsed cars may require more maintenance and repairs than new cars, especially if they are older or have high mileage. This can result in higher maintenance costs, which can offset some of the savings you get from buying a used car.\n\n2. Higher Interest Rates\n\nIf you are financing a used car, you may have to pay a higher interest rate than if you were financing a new car. This is because lenders consider used cars to be a greater risk, as they are more likely to need repairs and maintenance.\n\n3. Limited Warranty\n\nMany used cars do not come with a warranty, or the warranty may have expired. This means that if something goes wrong with the car, you will have to pay for the repairs out of pocket. Some dealerships offer extended warranties for used cars, but these can be expensive.\n\n4. Unknown History\n\nWhen you buy a used car, you may not know the full history of the vehicle. The previous owner may not have disclosed all accidents or repairs, and there may be hidden issues that only become apparent after you have purchased the car.\n\n5. Less Advanced Features\n\nUsed cars may not have the latest technology and safety features that are available on new cars. This can be a disadvantage if you are looking for a car with advanced features, such as a backup camera or lane departure warning.\n\nConclusion\n\nBuying a used car can be a great option for many people, as it offers a lower price, slower depreciation, lower insurance costs, more options, and no hidden fees. However, there are also some disadvantages to buying a used car, such as higher maintenance costs, limited warranty, unknown history, higher interest rates, and less advanced features. Ultimately, the decision to buy a used car or a new car depends on your personal preferences and budget."

        "output": "Because the Earth's atmosphere scatters the light of the sun, and blue light scatters more readily than other colors in the spectrum, we tend to see the sky as blue.\n\nLight can be affected by the medium it passes through. For example, a prism separates white light into a spectrum of colors, and a mirror reflects the light entirely. When it passes through the atmosphere, light gets scattered. If unimpeded, the light of the sun is white.\n\nBlue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors of light, and it scatters more easily. It is this scattering which makes it perceptible to the human eye.When the sun starts to set, the light is passing through even more atmosphere, and yet further colors are visible (such as orange and red).\n\nYou can read more at https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/, where I researched this answer."

You can also scramble eggs in a pot or pan. To do this you whisk a few eggs in a bowl with some milk, could be any kind of milk like skim milk or a dairy free milk like almond milk. Preheat the stove to medium heat and warm the pot or pan while you do this. Then pour the eggs into the pan and continually stir the eggs, scraping the bottom of the pan to ensure the eggs are fluffy. You can also poach an egg by cracking an egg into boiling water. Lastly, you can make a hardboiled egg by putting a desired number of eggs in a pot of water before placing on the stove. Once on the stove bring to a boil for 7-8 minutes."

The United States has the highest per capita household income of any country in the world, thus people in the United States are more able to afford iPhones than are people outside the United States. A secondary reason for iPhone\u2019s relative popularity in the United States is cultural: an iPhone is seen as a sort of status symbol, and some iPhone features only work with other iPhones, thus some people feel they will be \u201cmissing out\u201d socially if they have an Android phone instead of an iPhone."

        "output": "The most invaded country in history is difficult to determine definitively as there are many variables to consider. However, one country that has been invaded numerous times throughout its history is Poland. Poland has a long history of being invaded and occupied by various neighboring powers. In the 18th century, it was partitioned three times by Russia, Prussia, and Austria, and ceased to exist as an independent state for over a century\n\nDuring World War II, Poland was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany, resulting in the deaths of over six million Polish citizens, including three million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust. Following the war, Poland became a satellite state of the Soviet Union and was occupied by Soviet forces until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.\n\nThroughout its history, Poland has also been invaded by other powers, including the Mongols, Teutonic Knights, and Ottoman Empire, among others. The country's location in central Europe, as well as its fertile land and valuable resources, have made it a target for invasion throughout history.\n\nOverall, while there is no definitive answer to which country has been the most invaded in history, Poland's history of being invaded and occupied by numerous neighboring powers makes it a strong contender for this title."

        "instruction": "What is the best modern motorcycle for a beginning rider?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "If you have no or little experience with motorcycles, choosing a good first motorcycle can be challenging. While it is tempting to buy your dream supersport or touring cruiser, your first bike should be one that you can feel confident on so you can quickly master the skills necessary to ride a faster or larger bike more safely. Assess a new bike not from a place of desire, but from practical perspective, and consider these qualities:\n\n- Seat height: For most new riders, confidence comes more quickly when you can place both feet on the ground with a little bend in the knees. If you have a 32\" inseam, consider bikes with a 31\" or less seat height. If you have a 28\" inseam, consider bikes with a 27\" or lower seat height. Note that some bikes have wider \"waists\" that require you to spread your legs farther apart, so visit a dealer and sit on a variety of bikes until you find ones that you can sit comfortable atop with both feet planted.\n\n- Center of gravity: Bikes weigh from 250 lbs (dirt bikes) to over 800 lbs (large \"dresser\" cruiser bikes). Most bikes weigh between 400 and 600 lbs. However, weight isn't what makes a bike tip over easily -- rather, it's where the center of gravity is located. Sport bikes and adventure bikes carry their weight higher and more forward in the frame, where as standard and cruiser bikes carry it lower and closer to the rider. If you, as a new rider, grab a fistful of front brake during a low speed maneuver, what is going to cause the bike to start tipping over faster? Having a heavy weight high and forward. When assessing a first bike, look at where the engine and transmission mass seems to be centered relative to rider position. Sit on the bike with both feet planted and tilt it a little to the left and the right. Do you feel more or less strain on your shoulders as you bring it back it back to center? If you feel more, that sensation will become a danger when your learning low speed maneuvers and require more physical compensation, and will inhibit your ability to develop a good low speed riding technique.\n\n- Ergonomics: Most people feel cool in a racer's lean on a supersport, or slung back in a feet-forward posture when riding a cruiser. However, starting in those positions as a new rider can lead to discomfort, or inhibit your ability to develop solid basic riding techniques. Ideally, you want to be upright, elbows loose and bent and even with the bars. Your back should be straight with about a 5 degree forward lean. Your feet should be below your hips with a comfortable bend to the knees. In this position, you have the flexibility to better compensate for a lack of experience and technique when you encounter challenging situations on the road.\n\n- Engine displacement: Much ado is made about choosing the right displacement for a start bike. This is a bit of a myth: very few bikes, regardless of displacement, are fundamentally hostile to a new rider when it comes to engine performance: they are as fast or as slow as you treat the throttle. That said, smaller displacement bikes tend to be lighter, have lower seats, and are generally more newbie-friendly. However, some larger displacement bikes, including 650-900cc standards and 1100cc-plus cruisers can also be safe to learn on, as they favor low-revving torque over high-revving horsepower, with relatively gentle throttle response but plenty of grunt to push you forward from idle without extensive clutch feathering and rev management. Conversely, some smaller bikes, like the Kawasaki Ninja 250, require extensive revving and frequent gear shifting to get to street and highway speeds. Ask yourself: Do I want a light bike that will force me to learn good gear and rev management (a good idea if you have track aspirations), or a heavier bike that starts moving right off idle and requires less gear changing at street speeds? That's your answer to the question of displacement.\n\n- Throttle and brake response. Modern fuel injection, ECU development, and environmental emissions regulations have led to a situation where many sportier bikes have notchy throttles at low speeds, where closing the throttle cuts fuel and causes the bike to lurch a bit. This can be unpleasant for new riders who have yet to learn partial clutch management skills. Additionally, powerful sport bikes with inline-4 or V4 engine configuration can stutter and lurch at very low revs, requiring careful clutch and rev management that might be unfamiliar or uncomfortable to new riders -- these are bikes designed to be ridden fast, high in their powerbands. Additionally, powerful supersports and \"hooligan\" supermotos have very powerful brakes, like Brembo's Stylema or M4 units, which can easily pitch a new rider over the bars if they haven't developed a light, progressive touch on the brakes. If you, as a new rider, are having to spend your riding time compensating for unpredictable throttle behaviors or aggressive brakes, you aren't in a place to quickly learn good techniques safely.\n\nSo with all that in mind, what are some good starter bikes?\n\n- Kawasaki Ninja 400 or Z400: If your ambition is to ride a powerful supersport (like Kawasaki's own ZX-10R), start with a Ninja 400 or Z400. The Ninja is similar in style to supersport bikes, but has raised \"clip-on\" handle bars that convey the appearance of a racer but raise the incline of your posture to a more comfortable space. They also have a slightly lower seat height, and an accommodating 399cc parallel-twin motor with good throttle response and solid but unthreatening brakes. The Z400 is a more upright version of the Ninja 400 that shares the same engine and brakes, but lacks the plastic fairing and clip-on grips. Similar bikes include Yamaha's 321cc R3 and MT-03, Honda's CBR500F and CBR500R, KTM's RC390 and Duke 390, and BMW's G310. All of them perform very similarly, and are considered great gateway bikes to sport riding. Many track enthusiasts favor these bikes due to their light weight, engaging engines, and overall low cost of maintenance and insurance. If you really feel the need for speed so early in your riding career, Yamaha's MT-07 and Triumph's Trident 660 are relatively safe choices.\n\n- Triumph Street Twin 900. While well over 400 lbs, Triumph's Street Twin 900 is a very newbie friendly bike with a smooth, slow revving 900cc parallel-twin engine that puts down a lot of grunt and requires very little rev management -- you can short shift it any gear and still have the torque to move away cleanly without any fuss. Its comfortable seat and neutral \"standard\" riding position, along with its traction control and ABS features, mean that riding it is effortless and you won't be sore when you step off it after a long day cruising the backroads. It carries its weight low and close to the rider, and has a low-ish seat height of approximately 30\". Brakes are progressive without being intimidating, and a new rider will quickly learn good technique astride it. It also looks the part of a modern retro motorcycle, with clean curb appeal. Similar bikes include Moto Guzzi's V7 series, Kawasaki's Z650RS, and Royal Enfield's 650cc Interceptor.\n\n- Honda's Rebel 500. While it may not be the most eye-catching cruiser at the local Starbucks, Honda's Rebel 500 is a great gateway to the cruiser world. The 500cc engine is tuned for torque, not speed, and its low seat height of around 26\" means it is approachable by riders of all heights. It can keep up with larger bikes and serves as an effective commuter, with low costs of insurance and maintenance, and can be easily customized. Similar bikes include Royal Enfield's 350 Meteor and 650 Super Meteor, and Honda's 600cc Shadow line. For those not intimidated by weight, Harley-Davidson's 1700cc Heritage Softail is a surprisingly accommodating bike for new riders, with a low seat height and an impressive center of gravity that makes the bike feel a couple hundred pounds lighter once bumped off its kickstand. Avoid the older Sportster line, often inappropriately pitched as \"the Harley for new riders\" due to their relatively low displacements compared to KD's more upmarket models -- these bikes have very high-and-forward centers of gravity and weak front brakes that can easily inhibit your skills development.\n\nLastly, if you're looking at adventure bikes, Royal Enfield's 400cc Himalayan, Kawasaki's Versys 300X, and BMW's G310GS provide light weights, friendly engines, and reasonable seat heights all while being moderately well-equipped for gravel or graded dirt roads.\n\nThe most important thing, however, is to take the time to sit on the bikes at a dealer and think hard about the qualities discussed in this article. If you fall in love with the hobby, the bike you get today will not be the bike you have tomorrow. Focus on learning, not fashion, and make a choice that feels comfortable and safe to you."

        "input": "",
        "output": "There are three main types of toilets found in RVs, with some rarer options available. Most RVs work off a \u201ctank\u201d system, with sink and shower water going into the \u201cgray\u201d tank and toilet waste going into the \u201cblack\u201d tank. These tanks then need to be emptied on a regular basis dependent on their capacity. Toilets that work with a tank system tend to work like residential toilets, but use less water and have a foot pedal for flushing. There are two other types of toilets found often in DIY conversion RVs or \u201coff-grid\u201d RVs. First, cassette toilets are essentially holding tanks for toilet waste that are then pulled out of the RV and manually emptied. The \u201ccassette\u201d portion of the toilet is often on wheels, and can be emptied at either a dump station or in a public toilet. Composting toilets are the final common toilet type found in RVs. Composting toilets are a \u201cdry\u201d toilet, where waste goes into a holding tank with a composting material and becomes compost. The compost mixture must be stirred occasionally, but composting toilets often need to be emptied less often. There are less common toilets in RVs, for example incineration toilets, but they are not currently prevalent."

It is on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London and is a Grade I listed building. Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present structure, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the city after the Great Fire of London. The earlier Gothic cathedral (Old St Paul's Cathedral), largely destroyed in the Great Fire, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul's walk and St Paul's Churchyard, being the site of St Paul's Cross.\n\nThe cathedral is one of the most famous and recognisable sights of London. Its dome, surrounded by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At 365 ft (111 m) high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1963. The dome is still one of the highest in the world. St Paul's is the second-largest church building in area in the United Kingdom, after Liverpool Cathedral."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Palmitoylation is the covalent attachment of fatty acids, such as palmitic acid, to cysteine (S-palmitoylation) and less frequently to serine and threonine (O-palmitoylation) residues of proteins, which are typically membrane proteins. The precise function of palmitoylation depends on the particular protein being considered. Palmitoylation enhances the hydrophobicity of proteins and contributes to their membrane association. Palmitoylation also appears to play a significant role in subcellular trafficking of proteins between membrane compartments, as well as in modulating protein\u2013protein interactions. In contrast to prenylation and myristoylation, palmitoylation is usually reversible (because the bond between palmitic acid and protein is often a thioester bond). The reverse reaction in mammalian cells is catalyzed by acyl-protein thioesterases (APTs) in the cytosol and palmitoyl protein thioesterases in lysosomes. Because palmitoylation is a dynamic, post-translational process, it is believed to be employed by the cell to alter the subcellular localization, protein\u2013protein interactions, or binding capacities of a protein.\n\nAn example of a protein that undergoes palmitoylation is hemagglutinin, a membrane glycoprotein used by influenza to attach to host cell receptors. The palmitoylation cycles of a wide array of enzymes have been characterized in the past few years, including H-Ras, Gs\u03b1, the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In signal transduction via G protein, palmitoylation of the \u03b1 subunit, prenylation of the \u03b3 subunit, and myristoylation is involved in tethering the G protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane so that the G protein can interact with its receptor."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The UK telephone numbering system has a strange and complicated pattern which is born out of many historical changes and anomalies. Essentially nearly all numbers start with 0 when dialled in the UK. The leading 0 is omitted when calling from overseas and the prefix \"+44\" is added in its place. The second digit indicates what type of number it is. So called geographic numbers (those associated with an area code) start with 01or 02. Numbers starting with 03 are not associated with any area code but are charged at the same rates as numbers beginning with 01 or 02. Mobile numbers always start with 07. Numbers starting 09 are premium rate numbers which incur high charges for providing additional services.  Numbers starting with 080 are toll free. Other numbers starting with 08 are charged at special rates but not the very high rates for 09 numbers.\n\nSpecial numbers that do not start with 0 include 999 and 112 for emergencies, 101 for non emergency Police matters, 111 for contacting the National Health Service in a non emergency and directory enquiries services that start with 118.\n\nThe history of UK area codes (beginning 01 and 02) dates back to the times when individual telephone exchanges had their own one, two or three character Subscriber Trunk Dialing (STD) codes (e.g. B for Birmingham or AY6 for Aylesbury). in 1966 STD codes were converted to numbers using the number patterns on telephone dials (where 2=ABC, 3 = DEF etc.) so Birmingham became 021, Aylesbury became 0296. 01 was the code allocated to London. Area codes were between 2 and five characters long including the leading zero. Following the area code a local number of between 3 and 7 digits was added for each line to make the complete number either 9 or 10 digits long. Callers within the same area code could dial other lines with the same code by simply dialling the local number omitting the area code. In 1968 area codes beginning 00 were moved to free up 00 for other uses.\n\nBy the 1980s a number of factors meant that some areas, especially London, were running out of codes. Various measures were introduced including, in 1990,  the splitting of London into 071 (inner London) and 081 (outer London).\n\nThe 80s and 90s also saw the gradual introduction of \"non geographic\" numbers e.g. the toll free 0800 numbers and a number of patterns for emerging mobile services. Premium rate services were also launched using 0898.\n\nIn 1995 on so called \"phONEday\" a leading 1 was added after the zero. London numbers became either 0171 or 0181, Birmingham 0121, Aylesbury 01296 etc.\n\nThis established the pattern we see today allowing for some area codes to move to \"02\" codes over the next few years. In addition larger cities were allocated new codes beginning 011 e.g. 0113 for Leeds, 0117 for Bristol.\n\nIn 2000 the \"big number change\" saw London codes changed yet again = 0171 became 020 7 and 0181 became 020 8 allowing for new London numbers to be issued starting with 020 3 and 020 4 . Other cities that gained \"02\" style codes were Southampton/Portsmouth 023 , Coventry 024 and Cardiff 029.  A unified code of 028 was introduced in Northern Ireland."

He was the founder of Ford Motor Company, and chief developer of the assembly line technique of mass production. Ford created the first automobile that middle-class Americans could afford, and his conversion of the automobile from an expensive luxury into an accessible conveyance profoundly impacted the landscape of the 20th century.\n\nFord was born on a farm in Michigan's Springwells Township to a Belgian family, leaving home at age 16 to work in Detroit. It was a few years before this time that Ford first experienced automobiles, and throughout the later half of the 1880s, Ford began repairing and later constructing engines, and through the 1890s worked with a division of Edison Electric. He officially founded Ford Motor Company in 1903, after prior failures in business but success in constructing automobiles.\n\nFord's 1908 introduction of the Model T automobile revolutionized both transportation and American industry. As the Ford Motor Company sole owner, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with \"Fordism\", the mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford was also among the pioneers of the five-day work week. Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a franchise system that put dealerships throughout North America and major cities on six continents.\n\nFord was widely known for his pacifism during the first years of World War I. In the 1920s Ford promoted antisemitic content through his newspaper The Dearborn Independent, and the book, The International Jew. After his son Edsel died in 1943, Ford resumed control of the company but was too frail to make decisions and quickly came under the control of subordinates. He turned over the company to his grandson Henry Ford II in 1945. He died in 1947 after leaving most of his wealth to the Ford Foundation, and control of the company to his family."

What the artist do outside of it's musical activity ? it's longevity ?\nFor example we can say that Run-DMC has been the first rap group to really push the genre forward as they were the first group to be on Mtv, having a sponsorship with Adidas, and mixing Rock with Rap in their Song with Aerosmith, but their longevity has been shortened due to the murdering of Jam Master Jay.\nTupac or Notorious Big are acknowledged by a lot has the best rappers of all time because of their rhyme scheme and the fact that their song remains classics today."

        "input": "",
        "output": "A transistor is a constructed from materials that behave as semiconductors--which is to say that these materials conduct electrical current but only when certain conditions are met. By combining these materials into a device called a transistor we are able to create an electronic component that will only conduct electricity when a small electric current is applied to the so-called Base pin of the transistor.\n\nOne obvious use of such behavior is to use the transistor as a switch--by applying or removing current to the base pin we are able to control whether the transistor conducts electricity via its collector and emitter pins. When no current is present at the Base pin the transistor will block electrical transmission through its emitter and collector pins.\n\nGenerally speaking, the electrical current required to control the transistor at the base pin is very small. Much larger currents can be transferred through the device through the collector and emitter pins. Thus, in effect, a transistor uses a very small input current to control the flow of a much larger current.\n\nAn audio signal, for example, is transmitted as a very low power electrical current--in it's original form it is too small to be able to drive a loudspeaker to make sounds that are audible to the human ear. To amplify this signal so that is usable for audio playback we can apply the audio signal to a transistor's base pin--this will allow a much larger current to flow between the emitter and collector pins and through the transistor. Since the flow of this large current will mirror the much smaller current of the audio signal we will have effectively created a much stronger version of the original input signal."

Improving body positioning will have the most benefit at the lowest cost. Because wheel spokes are continuously cutting through air as you ride, they induce drag. Spokes on wheels with less aerodynamic drag allow for the wheels to roll with less resistance. Aerodynamic wheels are generally lighter which also decreases rolling drag."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Wood expands and shrinks depending on its moisture content.  The relative amount of change, expansion, or shrinkage differs for each of the three main grain directions.  Those directions are longitudinal, radial, and tangential.  Longitudinal is the direction a tree or its branches grows length-wise.  In most lumber, this is its length.  The change in this direction is very small.  That is why a wooden ruler can be used without changing its measurements when ambient moisture changes.  In almost all uses, longitudinal expansion and contraction are small enough not to be of concern.  Radial and tangential directional expansion and contraction are significant and different enough that they affect the dimensional stability of a piece of wood.  The relative amount of change in each direction is specific to the wood species.  Regardless of wood species, the change is greater in the tangential direction than in the radial direction.  The tangential direction is tangential to the growth rings in the wood, and the radial direction is perpendicular to the growth rings.  The T/R or ratio of tangential to radial change correlates to the dimensional stability of a wood species.  If you visualize a piece of lumber that is milled square and comes from a part of a log such that the rings are almost straight across in one direction, that is referred to as vertical grain or quarter sawn.  As the moisture content of the wood changes to come into equilibrium with its environment, it will move toward a diamond shape.  The closer the T/R ratio is to 1, the less the square dimension will distort. Dimensional stability and the direction of wood movement is important to plan for when cutting joinery in wood.  If two joined pieces are aligned so that they will not move in the same direction relative to the joint, the joint will be unstable when the ambient humidity changes and can cause the joint to fail."

If anyone wants to borrow something from the safe, they have to provide that key to open the safe. Generally, safe owners don't want this key to be given to everyone, so they create external locations specific to everyone's needs. Storage credential owners can create multiple safes and distribute their keys instead. So, in summary, Storage Credential and External Locations work together to unlock a secret."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Congratulations on your growing family! Pets are often treated like another member of the family and while they can require a lot of work, they can also bring a lot of joy and laughter into your life.\n\nHere are a few options for pets and some advantages and disadvantages for each:\n\n1. Dogs - Dogs can be amazing pets. They are typically very loyal, friendly, and beloved by families all over the world. Dogs can be taught to do tricks like sit, stay, and fetch. There are also over 300 different breeds of dog and they come in all kinds of sizes, ranging from a few lbs (1-2 kg) to over 150 lbs (70 kg). Dogs require quite a bit of work to train and can be very expensive to own due to high veterinary bills. Some dogs can be aggressive, and this is an important factor to consider given that you have two young children. Dogs also typically require access to a yard or regular walking to ensure that they are not going to the bathroom inside. Also, many people are allergic to dogs due to the fact that most dogs shed. If your family members are prone to allergies and are still looking to add a dog to the family, perhaps you should consider a hypoallergenic breed like a Yorkshire Terrier, poodle, or a poodle mix like a Golden Doodle. Dogs typically live between 7-15 years, depending on the breed. \n\n2. Cats - Cats are another very popular pet option for families. Like dogs, they come in many different breed options but there are far fewer breed options for cats than dogs. Most cats grow to be about 10 lbs (4 kg), but they can range in size from around 5 lbs (2 kg) to 25 lbs (11 kg). Indoor cats typically live between 12-18 years. Cats typically require far less work and are generally more independent than dogs. While most cats can't be trained to do tricks, cats are often lower maintenance than dogs. Cats can often be left alone at the house for a long time. Most cats use a litter box to relieve themselves so they typically don't need regular walks or access to a yard. Like dogs, most cats shed, so allergies and cleaning pet dander can be a nuisance. Cats typically eat less than dogs and often are less expensive to own.\n\n3. Fish - Fish are a popular pet option for families that are looking for a very low maintenance pet that only requires feeding a couple of times per day. Fish typically require water, a clean fish tank and fish food, and that's about it. Some pet fish, like goldfish, can be bought for as little as $10, while exotic fish can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Most pet fish will live up to 2 years if properly cared for, but certain species can live up to 30 years. \n\n4. Reptiles - Reptiles like snakes, lizards, or iguanas can also be pets. They typically require low maintenance and can live for up to 20-30 years. They require a cage, regular feeding, and are generally easy to take care of. For medical emergencies, they may require specialized veterinarians or doctor's, which can be hard to find.\n\n5. Rodents - rodents like gerbils, hamsters and even mice can be pets as well. They require regular feeding and a small cage, and are typically very easy to take care of. People often include a running wheel in the cage for these small animals so that they can exercise. However, they don't live very long; most rodents only live for a couple of years at most. \n\nIn addition to the list above, there are many other options for pets such as guinea pigs, rabbits, pigs and even exotic options like monkeys. Depending on where you live, there may be certain restrictions on the types of pets that you can own. Please be sure to check with these restrictions before buying your family pet."

Many people find working out in the morning energizes them for the rest of the day, and they feel the most willing to start their day off with rigorous activity. Others find a midday workout to revitalize them when hitting a slump. Some folks are more inclined to workout in the evenings to release the stress of the day. The time of day is less important than the type of activity, ensuring the activity is safe for your health, and that you are properly fueled with healthy nutrition and well rested. Daily activity is important to overall physical and mental health, so even light to moderate exercise has tremendous benefits. In short, worry less about the time of day and more on the quality of the activity and benefits you get."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Lacrosse is the original and oldest sport in North America.  it is one of the national sports of Canada.  It was created by French-Canadian Jesuit missionary priests in Canada, in the 17th Century.  The game of lacrosse is based on the traditional Native American game \"baggataway.\"'  This means \"little brother of war;\" it was also commonly referred to as \"The Creator's Game.\"  There are currently three predominant versions of lacrosse: Field Lacrosse, Box Lacrosse, and Women's Lacrosse.  \nField lacrosse is the men's outdoor version of the game.  There are 10 players on each team, on the field at once.  These players consist of 3 attackmen, 3 midfielders, 3 defensemen, and one goalie.  Each player has a helmet, shoulder pads, gloves, elbow pads, and a lacrosse stick.  6 players carry a short stick, which measures between 40 to 42 inches, and a maximum of four players on the field at a time can carry a long stick, which is between 52 and 72 inches long.  Short sticks are generally used by offensive players, and long sticks by defensive only players.  The goalie has a specific stick to his position, with a. wider \"head\" to assist in making saves.  The ball for play is made of solid rubber, about the size of a baseball.  A lacrosse goal measures 6 feet by 6 feet.  Teams are awarded one point for getting the ball into the goal.  \nEach game is 60 minutes long, made up of four 15 minute periods.  At the start of each period, and after ever goal, there is a face-off at the center of the field.  A unique aspect of lacrosse is that on a shot, when the ball goes out of bounds, possession is awarded to the team closet to the ball when it went out.  On out of bounds other than a shot attempt, possession is awarded to the opposite team that touched it last.  During the course of play teams may substitute players \"on the fly,\" through a designated substitution area (commonly referred to as \"the box\"), which is in between the benches of both teams.\nPenalties in lacrosse result from rule violations, deemed by either an infraction (commonly referred to as a \"technical foul\"), or a personal foul.  The result of the offending team is either losing possession of the ball, or temporarily losing a player for a designated period of time (similar to hockey).  The offending player serves their penalty in the box.  The team that has taken the penalty is the playing \"man-down\" for the time serving portion of the rule violation, while the other team is player \"man-up.\"\nThe generally consensus for who the greatest lacrosse player of all time is usually between three players: Jim Brown, Gary Gait, and John Grant."

        "input": "",
        "output": "While it is generally true that audiophiles are willing to spend more money on high-end gear than those less passionate about audio, justification for this additional financial outlay is not solely based on the equipment\u2019s definitive sonic superiority.\n \nThere are a handful of key attributes that define audio equipment\u2019s performance, including: frequency response, detail, texture, layering ability, coherency, vocal presentation, and timbre and tonality. Audiophiles typically seek out gear capable of performing well in many or all of these areas, and it is often these elevated expectations that drive an audiophile\u2019s willingness to spend more. However, there are elements of subjectivity at play, as well as physiological differences, that can lead to variations in interpretation of what sounds \u201caccurate\u201d or \u201cengaging.\u201d Therefore, even if it is generally true that most expensive audio equipment objectively performs better than their lesser priced counterparts, individual preference and anatomy can cause differences in expectations or hearing that can lead to different perceptions of sonic performance, even with high-end audio gear.\n \nThe Erlkonig is an In-Ear Monitor made by German producer, Vision Ears. By many, it is thought to be one of the best In-Ear Monitors ever made. At a retail price of over $4,000, it is also generally considered to be quite expensive. Widely regarded to perform extremely well, the Erlkonig has 13 balance armature drivers, 4 user-selectable sound settings, and shells made out of silver. While non-audiophiles will likely scoff at its price and be indifferent to the Erlkonig\u2019s specifications, many audiophiles will salivate at the chance for even a single listen. Even though many deep-pocketed audiophiles could justifiably purchase the Erlkonig, there are plenty of audiophiles and non-audiophiles who do not enjoy the IEM\u2019s sound. For others, the shell is ergonomically incompatible with their ears. So, even if expensive audio gear on the whole performs and sounds \u201cbetter\u201d than lesser priced gear, unique preferences and anatomical variation also shape perception of sonic performance."

        "output": "The reason Americans feel so strongly about gun control is partly rooted in the history of the United States. Originally, colonial Americans mostly lived outside of towns, farming and hunting in the countryside. This meant that guns were not just for protection, they were for obtaining crucial food resources. The British threat to take away guns was more than a political imposition limiting resistance to British rule, it was potentially a life-threatening policy to families who depended on obtaining food via hunting. This background is in part why Americans originally had such a strong reaction to normalizing gun controls and access, which was codified as a right to bear arms in our Constitution. However, by contrast this aspect of the rationale against gun control largely does not exist today. Gun usage is for sport, and for protection, and only minimally to provide food on the table. However, because of this history, and constitutional codification, Americans feel justified in maintaining one of the world's most vigorous objections to any regulation or controls."

For example, succulent-type plants may require less frequent waterings than their green-leafy counterparts. Research your new plants' preferred sunlight, water, and humidity requirements so you can provide the best care. Second, be sure to review your newly acquired houseplant for any pests before introducing them into your home. You\u2019ll want to check the leaves for mealy bugs, spider mites, etc. and the soil for pests such as fungus gnats. If you find any of these be sure to quarantine your new plant away from your current plants and treat with a pesticide of your choosing. Many houseplant owners use neem oil to treat pests. Third, upsize or repot your plant only when it is ready. Your new plant likely will be happy for a while in its current nursery (plastic) container that it came home from the shop in. You can choose to upsize the pot once you notice signs of the plant being root bound (the roots take up a majority of the pot) such as water draining from the pot quickly and the soil not becoming saturated or the plant slows its growth of new leaves (unless its the winter season at which time plants naturally slow or stop new growth).

Data can be generated from various sources and this raw data may be structured, semi structured or even unstructured. To make sense of this data, data has to be ingested and transformed. This is when data engineering comes into picture. Data engineering includes the process of extracting the raw data, ingesting data into a system like a data lake, transforming the data for business needs and finally loading it into a table. This is commonly known as ELT (Extract-Load-Transform). ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) is also possible where transformation happens before the loading stage.\nData Science and Analytics is the next step in the data lifecycle. Once the data needed for specific business need is available, data scientists use this data to run machine learning models to find the most accurate model. This data is available to the data scientists in the form of tables. Data analysts also use this data to do some exploratory analysis and create dashboards. \nIn essence, the data lifecycle would look as follows:\nRaw data from different sources -> Data Engineering -> Data Science and Analytics"

Users can also ride content from RGT thanks to Wahoo\u2019s acquisition of the company.  Wahoo system is aimed at what is defined as \u201ctime crunched athletes, and uses a 4 dimensional power profile, rather than the FTP (Functional Threshold Power) that other systems use.\n\nZwift is one of the oldest virtual cycling system, and is based on a social experience that allows riders to communicate with others nearby, do group rides, workouts and Races.  Zwift was not the first to introduce many of the virtual riding concepts, but the platform gained thousands of users during the covid-19 pandemic, and capitalised on the professional esports arena as well.\n\nZwift uses a more game-like graphical system, with multiple worlds that users can ride, with a monthly calendar changing the available worlds to ride it.  Zwit also has a comprehensive workout catalog.\n\nRouvy is a cycling platform that contains many of the features already mentioned, but it uses real world videos, with rider avatars superimposed over the top (Augmented Reality).  This gives you the feeling of actually riding the location you have selected, while seeing your vital statistics in the heads-up display.\n\nBKool is another software company offering many of the features that have been described in Zwift and Rouvy.  \n\nFulGaz is a newer platform that offers real video riding in high definition, and allows riders to upload their own videos to the community.\n\nIf you are looking for a riding app that allows you to ride and meet other people, group ride and just enjoy your time on the bike, then Zwift is a good choice to make.  If you are looking for some serious training, with detailed fitness reporting, the Wahoo systems would make a lot of sense.  If you want some serious training, but also want the experience of riding in real locations around the world, the Rouvy is the one to try. \n\nEach system requires a subscription to ride."

An annotation (irrespective of the context) is a note added by way of explanation or commentary. Once a genome is sequenced, it needs to be annotated to make sense of it. Genes in a eukaryotic genome can be annotated using various annotation tools such as FINDER. A modern annotation pipeline can support a user-friendly web interface and software containerization such as MOSGA. Modern annotation pipelines for prokaryotic genomes are Bakta, Prokka and PGAP.\n\nFor DNA annotation, a previously unknown sequence representation of genetic material is enriched with information relating genomic position to intron-exon boundaries, regulatory sequences, repeats, gene names and protein products. This annotation is stored in genomic databases such as Mouse Genome Informatics, FlyBase, and WormBase. Educational materials on some aspects of biological annotation from the 2006 Gene Ontology annotation camp and similar events are available at the Gene Ontology website.\n\nThe National Center for Biomedical Ontology develops tools for automated annotation of database records based on the textual descriptions of those records.\n\nAs a general method, dcGO has an automated procedure for statistically inferring associations between ontology terms and protein domains or combinations of domains from the existing gene/protein-level annotations."

More generally, it can be thought of as the study of neuronal wiring diagrams with a focus on how structural connectivity, individual synapses, cellular morphology, and cellular ultrastructure contribute to the make up of a network. The nervous system is a network made of billions of connections and these connections are responsible for our thoughts, emotions, actions, memories, function and dysfunction. Therefore, the study of connectomics aims to advance our understanding of mental health and cognition by understanding how cells in the nervous system are connected and communicate. Because these structures are extremely complex, methods within this field use a high-throughput application of functional and structural neural imaging, most commonly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electron microscopy, and histological techniques in order to increase the speed, efficiency, and resolution of these nervous system maps. To date, tens of large scale datasets have been collected spanning the nervous system including the various areas of cortex, cerebellum, the retina, the peripheral nervous system and neuromuscular junctions.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are two types of connectomes; macroscale and microscale. Macroscale connectomics refers to using functional and structural MRI data to map out large fiber tracts and functional gray matter areas within the brain in terms of blood flow (functional) and water diffusivity (structural). Microscale connectomics is the mapping of small organisms' complete connectome using microscopy and histology. That is, all connections that exist in their central nervous system."

        "output": "Cricket is a sport first originated in Wngland. Cricket was invented by British. While cricket was primarily played starting 17th century, there have been some obscure and speculative references of sport being played in 13th century during era of King Edward II. Cricket is game played with a flat bat and a ball with each team consisting of 11 players. The goal of the game is to score as many runs as a team can score while getting their turn to bat and getting the other team out before they can reach their target. Each team can bat once and have to field while other team bats. Cricket is played in circular or oval shaped fields. The patch in the middle of the ground is called the pitch which is 22 yards in length. At each end of the pitch, three sticks are planted in the ground called stumps. Two small wooden pieces are placed on top of stumps called bails. This setup is called a wicket. Two batters from the batting team will bat on each end of the pitch. Runs are scored by hitting a ball and then running back and forth from one end of the pitch to another end. Batter can send the ball to the boundary while pitching on the ground one or more times to score 4 runs or hit the ball over the boundary without having it bounce on the ground to score 6 runs. Fielding team will place 11 of their players at various locations in the field. Person from the fielding team throwing the ball to a batter from batting team is called a bowler. Bowler\u2019s goal is to get the batter out. Bowler will typically throw the ball on the pitch letting it bounce once on the pitch and eventually reaching a batter. There are different ways to dismiss or get a batter out. The bowler can throw the ball to a batter, induce a shot from the batter and have that ball caught directly by one of the fielder in the field. Bowler can also throw the ball toward a batter to make him or her miss and to hit the stumps or bails, thus disturbing his wicket. Bowler will deliver ball 6 times when their turn comes up. The grouping of 6 deliveries that a bowler throws to a batter is called an Over. Batters can also get run out while attempting to score a run and getting caught outside of their safe zone marked by a crease at each end of the pitch. Modern game of cricket contains many versions. These versions are called Test Cricket, One day internationals (ODI), and Twenty20. Originally, game of cricket lasted for many days. In the older version of the game , each team got a chance to bat twice and field twice taking as many days as possible to conclude the game. In modern version of the game, this mode of play called Test Cricket has been fixed to five days. So, Test cricket can last as many as five days.  One day internationals (also referred to as ODI) is a game of cricket that lasts one day. Each side gets 50 overs to bowl to another team and each side gets to bat once. Goal of a team is to score as many runs as possible in 50 overs while restricting their opposition to lesser score or getting them out completely. ODI typically lasts for 6 to 7 hours. Even more popular version of the game is called Twenty20 or T20. In this mode of the game, each team only gets 20 overs to bat and have to get their opponents out in 20 overs or to restrict them to lesser number of runs. This mode of cricket is very popular because the game only lasts for 3 hours requiring much less time of the viewers. There are many countries beside England that currently play cricket making the sport a truly global sport. The countries that play cricket are England, South Africa, Australia, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, West Indies.  The sport is also played by new entrants in the game, namely Netherlands, Ireland, Namibia, UAE, Afghanistan, USA, Canada, Papua New Guinea."

Some ultras are measured in distance. Common distances are 50 kilometers, 100 kilometers, and 100 miles. Other ultras are measured in time. In a timed ultra format, participants run as far as they can in a pre-determined amount of time. An example of common timed ultras is the 12 hour format, the 24 hour format, and the 48 hour format. A third category of ultra running races is called \"Last Person Standing\". These races repeat a 4.167 mile \"yard\" (loop) each hour until only one person can complete a yard by themselves. That person becomes \"the last person standing\"."

The person or institution that agrees to sell a minimum number of securities of the company for commission is called the underwriter.\n\nThe term \"underwriting\" derives from the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Financial backers (or risk takers), who would accept some of the risk on a given venture (historically a sea voyage with associated risks of shipwreck) in exchange for a premium, would literally write their names under the risk information that was written on a Lloyd's slip created for this purpose."

Moreover, if your Data and AI platform is made up of multiple services and components the administrative burden of governing and securing data and users and keeping all parts working together can be overwhelming especially at enterprise scale.\n\n3) MLOps: To make the most of AI you need to be able to use it to impact your business. Hiring a full data science team without having the right ML engineering expertise or the right tools to package, test, deploy and monitor is extremely wasteful. There are several steps that go into running effective end-to-end AI applications and your operating model should reflect that in the roles that are involved and in the way model lifecycle management is executed from use case identification, to development to deployment, and perhaps most importantly utilisation.  \n\nThese three dimensions should inform your focus and the roles that should be part of your development team. Over time, the prevalence of certain roles might shift as your organisation matures along these dimensions and on the platform decisions that you make."

        "input": "",
        "output": "When choosing an electric vehicle, there are many factors to consider.  Before we get into those specific factors, let's take a quick look at the broader electric vehicle market to provide context for your choice of an electric vehicle.\n\nThe global vehicle market has made an intentional transition from combustion engine vehicles to electric powered vehicles. In that transition, here are some things to consider:\n1. This transition will continue to take place through 2030 - 2035.  This is the timeframe most of the traditional automotive original equipment manufacturers have declared that they will be 100% transitioned to electric vehicle production.  This is important because you can assume that the technology behind the electrification of automobiles will be evolving and improving over this time period.\n2. Tesla was the company that disrupted the automotive market by producing, marketing and servicing the first all-electric vehicles.  Today they have the lead in most vehicles sold in the all-electric vehicle category.  If your only criteria for choosing your electric vehicle is to choose a vehicle from the leader, you have your answer in Tesla.\n3. Fast followers to Tesla fall into two very broad categories that are important to consider in your choice of an electric vehicle:\n     1. Traditional automotive original equipment manufactures - These are the companies that have been in business of producing, marketing and servicing combustion engine vehicles. In this category, think of General Motors, Ford, Toyota, VW, BMW, Kia, Stellantis and the like.  These companies have expertise in large scale production, quality control, after sale servicing, warranty management, customer experience and have large R&D teams that have been studying vehicle electrification for many years.  In addition, they have a large dealership network to distribute and service their vehicles for your convenience.  \n     2. Startup companies - These are the companies that have recently entered the market, following Tesla's lead, in starting their own brand of all-electric vehicles.  In this category, think of Rivian, Canoo, Fisker, Arrival and Vinfast among others.  They lack the large scale production experience, facilities and employee mass of the traditional automotive manufacturers.  However, typically their strength is in being able to nimbly change, adapt, attract expertise from the automotive market and have incentives to attract customers.\n\nGiven the backdrop of the broader vehicle market, now here are some factors to consider:\n    1. Miles per charge - With is typically categorized as \"Range\". The median driving range of all-electric vehicles in 2021 is 234 miles per charge.  This factor  matters if you take long trips between convenient charges.  You also can inference that vehicles that have a range much under 234 miles per charge may not have high quality batteries.\n    2. Charging Stations - You never needed to consider this factor when buying a traditional vehicle, unless the vehicle was powered by some obscure fuel.  Now, this factor is very important to research.  You will want to consider the number of charging stations available in your area, the time per charge and options for home charging.\n    3. Maintenance and Warranty - if something does happen to your vehicle, how easy is it to find a certified center to get your repairs quickly and conveniently accomplished.\n    4. All the same factors if you were buying a traditional automotive - Price, Size, Style and incentives available for the purchase.\n\nIf you keep these factors in mind, you should have a good experience in choosing your all-electric vehicle."

        "instruction": "What are the primary causes of inflation?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "In economics, inflation is the growth rate of the price of goods and services for a particular selection of items. For example, items that a typical household consumes are captured in the Consumer Price Index, whereas items that domestic producers buy are included in the Producer Price Index. The drivers behind changes in the general price levels can be attributed to two main reasons. First, changes in the real demand and supply of goods and services will drive prices up or down. Higher prices will encourage suppliers to increase supply and discourage consumer demand reestablishing market equilibrium. Second, changes in the money supply \u2013i.e. the amount of currency in circulation, bank deposits, and other liquid monetary aggregates\u2013 can lead to inflation. When a country's central bank decides to increase the money supply through quantitative easing monetary policies, the amount of currency available to buy and sell the same amount of goods and services increases. If the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy remains unchanged (i.e. velocity of money is constant) then a higher money supply will lead to higher prices because there is more money to transact the same amount of goods and services in the economy."

The GC operations start at roughly one per minute and take less than five seconds each, but after 7:23 AM, they abruptly take about 30 seconds each and occur twice a minute. In other words, initially, GC operations take up a small fraction of the JVM time, while later, they take up almost all of its time.\n3. GC operations in this second period result in a very slight decrease in the total memory size and the PSYoungGen, ParOldGen, and Metaspace memory areas. This behavior is especially acute after 7:26:51 AM.\n4. This indicates much time spent in GC operations with little result.\n5. The total memory size initially slowly grows from 49.5GB to 52.3 GB, but in the second period maxes out at around 78 GB. \n6. The allocated memory size is fixed at 82 GB during the second period of GC operations, indicating an outer limit.\n7. I recommend increasing the maximum allocated memory beyond the 82 GB limit, doubling it if possible, and re-running the JVM."

This is where non-cumulative inequalities, manifested by multiple groups that each have strengths and weaknesses, fight for political power.  Groups form to represent constituencies, where leaders are elected and engage in compromise decision-making within their group and with leaders of other groups. Groups with opposing interests prevent the accumulation of power with one group.\nCritics of this theory argue that Dahl only talked about policy decisions that were openly debated.  There is a private or hidden power struggle where it is decided whether or not to consider policy at all. Second, that there are cumulative inequalities where those with a low level of resources are not able to mobilize and represent their own interests. Lastly, a group's leadership does not always represent the rank and file membership of the group as a whole."

A strong engineering culture allows engineers to work more effectively together.\n\nDifferent engineers often have different understanding or beliefs on the same topic, such as whether a PRD is needed for a design doc, or whether an engineer should write tests for their work. Without a strong engineering culture, engineers often waste timing debating on nuances, which can significantly hurt business productivity and create poor customer experience.\n\nLarge technology companies often have strong and unique engineering culture. For example: Apple favors design and quality; Amazon favors customer experience; Facebook favors success metrics; Google favors engineering excellence; Microsoft favors business success. Each engineering culture has its pros and cons. In general, having an engineering culture is better than not having one. A good leadership should intentionally foster a strong engineering culture in their company."

But for many, suffering can come to dominate their lives, due to abuse, the loss of loved ones, difficult relationships, mental illnesses, or disability. By finding meaning in ones life, the hard times full of suffering can be tempered with hope: for a better life for your children, for a better world, or a better after-life. Without finding something to give your life meaning, you risk falling into nihilism, anger, and despair. And those feelings tend to set you on a self-reinforcing path, and drag others down with you. While people often start looking for meaning in their lives when they encounter suffering to explain that suffering, it is in embracing a purpose that you can find hope and reduce the suffering in the world."

In other words, the effect of the mutation is dependent on the genetic background in which it appears. Epistatic mutations therefore have different effects on their own than when they occur together. Originally, the term epistasis specifically meant that the effect of a gene variant is masked by that of a different gene.\n\nThe concept of epistasis originated in genetics in 1907 but is now used in biochemistry, computational biology and evolutionary biology. The phenomenon arises due to interactions, either between genes (such as mutations also being needed in regulators of gene expression) or within them (multiple mutations being needed before the gene loses function), leading to non-linear effects. Epistasis has a great influence on the shape of evolutionary landscapes, which leads to profound consequences for evolution and for the evolvability of phenotypic traits."

Each microphone technology was developed for a certain kind of environment.\n\nCondenser microphones like the Blue Yeti are designed to record their entire environment with the utmost clarity. If your environment is noisy then the microphone audio will be noisy. But if the environment has been acoustically treated then the recording will sound detailed and clear. \n\nDynamic microphones like the Shure SM7B are designed to record sounds spoken within a 18 inches of the front of the microphone. All other sounds will be quieter and less detailed. If the environment is noisy then the microphone audio will tend to mute out sound that comes from off-axis. If the environment is quiet then the audio will sound good, but only if the person or instrument being recorded is within 18 inches of the microphone.\n\nA ribbon microphone is designed to capture extremely loud percussion sounds, usually from drums or brass instruments.

        "input": "",
        "output": "Java and Python are two of the most popular programming languages. Of the two, Java is the faster language, but Python is simpler and easier to learn. Each is well-established, platform-independent, and part of a large, supportive community. But that is where the similarities end. When you\u2019re considering Python versus Java, each language has different uses for different purposes, and each has pros and cons to consider.\n\nAdvantages of Java\n\nSpeed and efficiency are two of the big draws of using Java. It's also one of the coding languages considered to be easy to learn. Because many of the processes of this high-level language run automatically, you won't have to do an intense study of how everything works as much as you would with a low-level language. You should be able to master it relatively quickly depending on how much time you can devote to learning and practicing. Other advantages of using Java include the following:\n\n(1) It's simple: The syntax is straightforward, making it easy to write. It's not as complex as languages like C++, and it uses automatic memory allocation.\n\n(2) It\u2019s platform independent: You can use Java on multiple types of computers, including Windows, iOS, Unix, and Linux systems, as long as it has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platform.\n\n(3) It\u2019s object oriented: Because you create classes containing data and functions and objects that belong to those classes, it offers a more intuitive approach for big project development. It also provides flexibility and easier troubleshooting, and the ability to reuse the code.\n\n(4) It has a large global community: This is helpful when you're learning Java or should you run into any problems.\n\n(5) It supports multithreading: When you use Java, you can run more than one thread at a time. When running multiple threads, they share a common memory area to increase efficiency and performance.\n\n(6) It\u2019s secure: Java avoids using explicit pointers, runs inside a virtual machine called a sandbox, uses byte-code verifier to check for illegal code, and provides library-level safety along with Java security package and run-time security checks. \n\nDisadvantages of Java\n\nBefore deciding whether Java is the right programming language for you to start with, it\u2019s essential to consider its weaknesses. One of the main downsides to using Java is that it uses a large amount of memory\u2014considerably more than Python.\n\nAdditionally, Java manages its memory through garbage collection, which happens once the application you\u2019re working on no longer references the object. Java\u2019s garbage collector clears it from memory, but during the process, other threads have to stop while the garbage collector works. The step impacts the overall performance of the application. Other disadvantages include:\n\n(1) It doesn\u2019t offer control over garbage collection: As a programmer, you won\u2019t have the ability to control garbage collection using functions like free() or delete().\n\n(2) It has a lot of words: Although Java is simple, it does tend to have a lot of words in it, which will often leave you with complex, lengthy sentences and explanations.\n\n(3) It doesn't have a native look when you use it for desktops: Java has multiple graphical user interface (GUI) builders, but they aren't the best if you're creating complex UI on a desktop. Java is weaker when you're using it for desktop versus mobile when it comes to user experience and user interface. While there are many GUI builders to choose from, you'll need to do a lot of research to find the right one for your project.\n\n\nPython: The simple path\n\nAlthough Java is faster, Python is more versatile, easier to read, and has a simpler syntax. According to Stack Overflow, this general use, interpreted language is the fourth most popular coding language.  It's also one of the most in-demand programming languages that hiring managers look for when hiring candidates, according to HackerRank, second only to JavaScript. \n\nPython's popularity has experienced explosive growth in the past few years, with more than 11.3 million coders choosing to use it, mainly for IoT, data science, and machine learning applications, according to ZDNet. Further, Python has had a 25 percent growth rate, adding 2.3 million developers to its community between Q3 2020 and Q3 2021, according to SlashData's \u201cState of the Developer Nation.\u201d.\n\nAdvantages of Python\n\nPython\u2019s versatility is difficult to match, and it's so flexible that it encourages experimentation. This keeps programmers from being pigeonholed into only building one type of application. You can learn just one language and use it to make new and different things.\n\nComputer Weekly calls Python the most versatile programming language, noting that \u201cAlthough there might be a better solution for any given problem, Python will always get the job done well\u201d. Other advantages of Python include:\n\n(1) It\u2019s platform-independent: Like Java, you can use Python on various platforms, including macOS, Windows, and Linux. You\u2019ll just need an interpreter designed for that platform.\n\n(2) It allows for fast development: Because Python is dynamically typed, it's fast and friendly for development. Additionally, it uses asynchronous code to tackle situations and challenges faster because each unit of code runs separately.\n\n(3) It offers extensive libraries: Its large library supports common tasks and commands. It also contains code that can be used for many different purposes, ranging from generating documentation to unit testing to CGI.\n\n(4) It offers a more flexible approach to programming: Python supports a variety of programming styles and has multiple paradigms. Not only is this optimal for programmers who enjoy flexibility, but it also makes it ideal for start-ups that might need to shift approaches abruptly.\n\n(5) It's free and open-source: You can download Python without any cost, and because it's so easy to learn and boasts one of the largest and most active communities\u2014you should be able to start writing code in mere minutes.\n\n(6) It may boost productivity: NetGuru says that Python is more productive than Java because of how concise it is and because it's dynamically typed. Additionally, it has control capabilities and integration features that can make applications more productive.\n\nDisadvantages of Python\n\nWhile Python is arguably one of the easiest and fastest languages to learn, it\u2019s also decidedly slower to execute because it\u2019s a dynamically typed, interpreted language, executed line-by-line. Python does extra work while executing the code, making it less suitable for use in projects that depend on speed. However, if speed isn\u2019t a sensitive issue, Python\u2019s slower nature won\u2019t likely be a problem.\n\nOther potential disadvantages include:\n\n(1) It only executes one thread at a time: Python has a Global Interpreter Lock that only lets one thread execute at a time, so if you're working on a multi-threaded CPU-bound program, it'll likely be even slower. Using multiprocessing programs instead of multithreaded programs can be an effective workaround.\n\n(2) It isn't mobile native: Python can be effectively and easily used for mobile purposes, but you'll need to put a bit more effort into finding libraries that give you the necessary framework. Some examples include Kivy, which lets you use the same API to create mobile apps and software that you can run on Raspberry PI, Linux, and Windows.\n\n(3) It uses a large amount of memory: If you're working on a project where many objects are active in RAM, this could present an issue for you. Switching to NumPy could be an effective workaround to reduce the amount of memory Python uses for each object."

        "input": "",
        "output": "There are three primary problems with the way the tax code treats incentive stock options. First, the tax code gives an employee a strong incentive to exercise the options early on, to achieve the tax benefit relating to the special option treatment. This means the tax code encourages young employees to write a check to their employer at a time when their entire financial life is likely to be dependent on that employer. This is the exact opposite of diversification, a key goal of personal financial management. The second issue is that the alternative minimum tax (AMT) is imposed at the time of exercise. This requires a potentially large cash outlay, at a time when the employee is unlikely to have sufficient liquidity to meet the burden. So not only does the employee have to pay his or her employer to cover the exercise premium, he or she has to send funds to the Internal Revenue Service as well. Finally, the requirement that an employee terminating employment must exercise within three months of termination date to preserve the tax advantage of the options encourages exercise at a time when the employee may not have sufficient funds, and may be looking at financial uncertainty if he or she does not yet have a new job lined up. The advantages of incentive stock options are significant, but they encourage the wrong behavior."

GFCI (or GFI) outlets are common in locations where water is present, for example in kitchens and bathrooms.\n\nIf the outlet is not a GFCI outlet or if resetting the GFCI outlet had no effect, locate the circuit breaker for your building and check if any of the circuits have been tripped.  You can identify a tripped circuit when you open the panel by looking for the one of the circuits in the panel that is not in the same orientation as the others.

Senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a governor's appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives. The U.S. vice president has a vote in the Senate only when senators are evenly divided. The House of Representatives has six non-voting members.\n\nThe sitting of a Congress is for a two-year term, at present, beginning every other January. Elections are held every even-numbered year on Election Day. The members of the House of Representatives are elected for the two-year term of a Congress. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 established that there be 435 representatives, and the Uniform Congressional Redistricting Act requires that they be elected from single-member constituencies or districts. It is also required that the congressional districts be apportioned among states by population every ten years using the U.S. census results, provided that each state has at least one congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators, so currently, there are 100 senators for the 50 states."

One summer day, while resting indolently with the King in the main hall of the royal palace, the Queen suddenly had a thought. \"How nice it would be, King, if we could build some beautiful statutes of Lord Jagannath so that the people can come worship Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subadhra. What do you think?\" \n\nThe King thought for a few minutes, and then nodded in agreement. \"What do you have in mind, my Queen?\" And so, soon the stone sculptor was summoned to appear before the Court for an appointment to build in his way the statutes of the gods. Soon the monsoon season started and the sculptor appeared in front of the court, awaiting his appointment. He was a humble man from the mountainous regions of Odisha. Even at his best-dressed, one couldn't help but notice his rough hands, and the small sprinkling of dust that seemed ever present in his hair. \n\nThe King and Queen graciously waited as the sculptor bowed and then asked \"Your majesties, what can I do for you?\" The Queen leaned forward in her throne and her voice rang out in the court \"We have heard, o Master Sculptor, of your skills from people far and wide across the Kingdom. We dream of having you put your skills to use to build beautiful statues that will represent Lord Jagannath, Subhadra, and Balabhadra for our people to worship.\"\n\nThe sculptor was silent. As his silence extended, ministers of the court began to feel restless. \"Speak up! How can you be silent when the Queen graces you so!\" But still, the sculptor was silent. \n\nThe King and Queen sat patiently in their thrones as they waited for the sculptor to respond. Perhaps the enormity of the task was too much. Perhaps, the sculptor was thinking of what he should ask for in return. Or even more, perhaps, the sculptor was awed and honored by the request. \n\nAt last, as the shadows from the late afternoon sun began to stretch across the floors of the hall, the sculptor shifted his weight, and opened his mouth to speak. \"Your majesties, you grace me with such a request, I cannot help but oblige. It is an honor.\" At this, the Queen sat as straight as a rod, listening for the words that would come next. \"But, I can do this on one condition only. I will work in a closed hall, where none may enter - regardless of whether they can hear me working or otherwise. None may enter until I open the doors from within and proclaim to all that the statues are completed.\"\n\nThe ministers gasped - what a strange request from this man. Was he a fool? What if he just slept and ate and didn't do any work? How could the King and Queen trust that he would do the work he was promising to do? The Queen looked on thoughtfully. She glanced at the King, and it seemed to her that he agreed on this condition without reservation. She looked at the sculptor and then nodded her assent. \"We decree that you shall build these statues in a hall set aside, into which no one shall enter until your work is complete and you proclaim that to us after opening the doors of the hall from within.\"",

Stack the wood in a way that guarantees oxygen can easily reach your flame. Many prefer a teepee or log cabin stacking design.

More specifically, it improves the read performance of filtered read operations which only require a subset of the dataset to be returned based on specific conditions. Bloom filters improve the performance of the reading mechanism by providing \"hints\" which state that data is definitely not in the file, or that it is probably in the file. This allows the reading mechanism to skip certain files when reading, improving performance."

Sake typically has an ABV of around 15%. \n\nSake is made from 4 ingredients: rice, yeast, water and Koji. First, rice is washed and then steamed. Then the rice goes into a special room where the environment is tightly controlled called the \u201cKoji Room\u201d where a special enzyme called Koji is sprinkled on the rice. The Koji converts the starch in the rice to sugar. Then, yeast and water is added to the rice in a large container to start the fermentation process of converting the sugar in alcohol. One the mixture is fermented to the right ABV, then the mixture is pressed which separates the liquid from the residue rice. Typically, the sake is the bottled and pasteurized for longer shelf life."

Practicing the presentation beforehand can help your confidence. Even if you're extremely nervous, if you know the content of the presentation you're going to have more confidence than otherwise.

        "instruction": "Is it wrong to split the infinitive?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "First, let's establish the meaning of a split infinitive. In simple terms the infinitive is the grammatical construct in which a verb is preceded by the word 'to': hence, 'to walk', 'to talk', 'to reason'. As a side-note, it's probably worth exploring whether the 'verbification' of nouns is a good thing: personally, I take issue with this and feel that examples such as 'to medal', meaning 'to win a medal at a sporting event', should never have been visited on the English language. But that's another discussion entirely. Returning to the infinitive, the split occurs when another word (usually an adverb) is placed between the word 'to' and its corresponding verb. Probably the most famous split infinitive occurs in the opening sequence of every episode of the classic and original TV show, Star Trek, with the lines:\n\"Space: The final frontier\nThese are the voyages of the Starship, Enterprise;\nIts five year mission:\nto explore strange new worlds;\nto seek out new life and new civilizations;\nto boldly go where no man has gone before.\"\nNote that final line: 'to boldly go'. Never has an infinitive been split so boldly before or since. Those who are grammatical pedants will have shuddered at this every time (and probably ended up preferring Star Wars to Star Trek as a consequence) but through those original seventy-nine episodes and their many repeat showings, the split infinitive has subtly embedded itself in our lexicon. \nSo, to return to the question, is it wrong to split the infinitive? Since language is constantly evolving, influenced by the whims and practices of each generation, the answer must be 'no'. On the whole sentences tend to flow more freely and with greater elan if infinitives aren't split and pesky adverbs are kept in their place either before or after ('to go boldly' or 'boldly to go') but sometimes one has to admit that splitting works, and we should be thankful for the colour that brings to the language we hear daily. Who nowadays wouldn't want to boldly go?"

Ranked voting will give centrist and more moderate candidates and parties a greater chance to succeed in elections, reducing the power of the extreme elements on both sides of the political spectrum. It will encourage more moderate candidates to step forward and more moderate third parties to form. The extreme partisanship currently existing in politics will be mitigated. Donald Trump would likely not have won the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 because, although he had a very committed backing of a large minority of Republican voters, he faced a divided field of more moderate and traditional candidates who split the more rational majority of the party. Trump would likely not have been the second choice for many of the backers of other candidates. A more moderate candidate would likely have emerged as the eventual nominee. Opponents of ranked voting cite possible complexity and greater threat of computerized hacking or errors impacting election results.

Using cellphone too much would take too much of your time, and you would spend less time reading books, doing exercises, playing outside, talking to people, which harms your overall development. Adults like me already ready lots of books, did lots of exercises, and talked to a lot of people when I was a teenager, so I already developed those skills.\n3.

Economists believe that an efficient national payment system reduces the cost of exchanging goods and services, and is indispensable to the functioning of the interbank, money, and capital markets. A weak payment system may severely drag on the stability and developmental capacity of a national economy; its failures can result in inefficient use of financial resources, inequitable risk-sharing among agents, actual losses for participants, and loss of confidence in the financial system and in the very use of money."

However, there would be a significant negative economic impact because dirigibles fly much more slowly than airplanes, thus the items airplanes carry (e.g. people and freight) would take much longer to get to their destination. In addition, another problem with dirigibles is that they are less able to handle strong winds compared to airplanes, so it might be necessary for the dirigible to take a more circuitous route than an airplane, or simply delay the flight until the bad weather passes."

The enzymes in the matrix facilitate reactions responsible for the production of ATP, such as the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, oxidation of pyruvate, and the beta oxidation of fatty acids.\n\nThe composition of the matrix based on its structures and contents produce an environment that allows the anabolic and catabolic pathways to proceed favorably for. The electron transport chain and enzymes in the matrix play a large role in the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The citric acid cycle produces NADH and FADH2 through oxidation that will be reduced in oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP.\n\nThe cytosolic, intermembrane space, compartment has a water content of 3.8 \u03bcL/mg protein, while the mitochondrial matrix 0.8 \u03bcL/mg protein. It is not known how mitochondria maintain osmotic balance across the inner mitochondrial membrane, although the membrane contains aquaporins that are believed to be conduits for regulated water transport. Mitochondrial matrix has a pH of about 7.8, which is higher than the pH of the intermembrane space of the mitochondria, which is around 7.0\u20137.4. Mitochondrial DNA was discovered by Nash and Margit in 1963. One to many double stranded mainly circular DNA is present in mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondrial DNA is 1% of total DNA of a cell.

The screens are pulled tight and held in a metal or wood frame. Much like a picture frame. Depending on the detail of the artwork, the screens can have different size weave. The weave is essentially how tight the screen is woven and how large the holes in the screen are. For more detailed designs, the screen used will be woven very close and tight so the holes are very small and let less ink through. This allows for very thin lines and detail. Each screen can print 1 color at a time. So, to print a design with multiple colors, there needs to be multiple screens. 1 screen per color. Many screen printing presses have large rotating arms that hold the screens. The arms rotate for each color to be printed individually."

Singapore started out as a British colony, where a free trading port was established for ships passing through the Malacca Straits. Singapore continued to thrive and became an important port globally which attracted many Chinese, Malay, Indian and Arab traders to operate in Singapore.\n\nSingapore continued to prosper for many years until World War II. On 15 February 1942, the British surrendered to Japan and Singapore was renamed to Syonan-to. During the Japanese occupation, over 2500 lives were executed and many suffered hardships.\n\nPost World War II, Singapore operated as a self-government led by Lee Kuan Yew, reducing its reliance on the British. During 1963 to 1965, Singapore had a merger with neighbouring country Malayisa. However, the merger brought about many disagreement, tensions and unrest. Eventually, Singapore separated from Malaysia and became a fully independent country on 9 August 1965."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Beginning in the early 1800s, the ballots used by cardinals were burned after each ballot to indicate a failed election. The lack of smoke instead signalled a successful election. Since 1914, black smoke (fumata nera) emerging from a temporary chimney installed on the roof of the Sistine Chapel indicates that the ballot did not result in an election, while white smoke (fumata bianca) announces that a new pope has been chosen.\n\nPrior to 1945 (when Pius XII changed the form of ballot to use unsigned ballots, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above had the effect of making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. The lack of sealing wax on the ballots explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 conclave. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color on the first day of that conclave.\n\nSince 1963, chemicals have been added to the burning process to augment the smoke's black or white color. Beginning in 2005, a successful election is also accentuated by bells ringing at the appearance of the white smoke.\n\nDuring the 2013 conclave, the Vatican disclosed the chemicals used to color the smoke\u2014the black smoke comprises potassium perchlorate, anthracene, and sulfur; the white smoke is composed of potassium chlorate, lactose, and pine rosin."

Although ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements, it is unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating, even at the highest levels of competition. The term \"frisbee\" is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company, and thus the sport is not formally called \"ultimate Frisbee\", though this name is still in common casual use. Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc, and interceptions, incomplete passes, and passes out of bounds are turnovers. Rain, wind, or occasionally other adversities can make for a testing match with rapid turnovers, heightening the pressure of play."

Press down the clutch pedal with one foot, and the brake with your other foot first and then turn on the engine of the car. It is recommended to shift to neutral immediately after turning on your car and prior to departing. To shift between one of the engaged gears, typically marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 N (for neutral) and R (for reverse), press down on the clutch all the way to the floor and move the shifter to the desired location. Once the car is on and you're in neutral if you want to move forward, press and hold the clutch pedal to the floor and move the shifter to the \"1\" position. Slowly disengage the clutch pedal partially, and while disengaging slowly start to press down on the gas pedal. After gradually pressing more on the gas pedal, slowly remove your foot from the clutch entirely. This will start you in forward motion, and you will be restricted to the speed limit of 1st gear. You can track this limit through the RPM (revolutions per minute) gauge on the dashboard of your car. Typically you want to keep the RPMs between 1500-4000. If the RPMs start to decrease to 1500-2000 that is a sign you want to shift from a higher gear to a lower gear (i.e. 2nd gear to 1st gear), and as the RPMs increase to 4000, that is an indication you want to shift to a higher gear (i.e. 2nd gear to 3rd gear)."

        "output": "The 2023 MLB season might break the total runs scored record in a regular season due to three rule changes.. \n\n1. Base sizes going from 15 inches per side to 18 inches per side. The increase in base size promotes safer stealing conditions for runners allowing them to more easily avoid contact with fielders. Also, the larger base surface area will help runners from \"over-sliding\" on the base leading to an out.\n\n2. Two disengagements per plate appearance. Pitchers are only allowed two forms of disengagement which will reduce the number of pickoff attempts and mound step offs. In the event of a third disengagement, the pitcher will be charged with a balk leading to a base advancement for any runner on base or a ball given to the batter.\n\n3. Eliminating the shift. When the time a pitch is thrown, all four infielders must be on the infield dirt or grass with two on each side of second base. This new rule will increase batting averages, hits per game, and more doubles."

It is common to use oak, mesquite, hickory and pecan pellets.  Next you will need to trim and season your brisket.  It is common to use mustard as a binder for your seasoning but is not required.  Common seasonings for brisket are salt, pepper and garlic.  It is recommend to season the brisket for at least 30 minutes before cooking but for best results allow the seasoned brisket to rest overnight in your refrigerator.  Once the brisket is properly seasoned, place the brisket on your pellet grill.  It is common in Texas to place the brisket fat side up.  In other areas of the country, it is more common to place the brisket fat side down.  Allow your brisket to smoke until it reaches an internal temperature of 175 degrees.  Depending on the size of the brisket this could take in excess of 12 hours.  Once the brisket reaches an internal temperature of 175 degrees, wrap the brisket with butcher paper to build better bark.  Alternatively you can wrap the brisket in foil which will finish the cooking faster but build less bark.  Place the wrapped brisket back in your pellet smoker and increase the temperature to 275 degrees Fahrenheit.  Once the brisket reaches a temperature of 205 degrees Fahrenheit remove the brisket from our pellet smoker and allow it to rest in a cooler or oven until the brisket reaches an internal temperature of 140 degrees.  Depending on the size of the brisket this could take between 2 and 3 hours.  Slice your brisket and serve."

As chaos began attacking the planet, Gaunt organized the emergency launch of available Tanith troopers.  When all was complete, only a single strength regiment was able to get off the planet.  Tanith itself was destroyed by  the forces of Chaos from orbit and Trooper Larkin, a sniper in the regiment, dubbed the regiment 'ghosts'.

Proteins are vital parts of living organisms, with many functions such as the formation of structural fibers of muscle tissue, enzymatic digestion of food, or synthesis and replication of DNA. In addition, other kinds of proteins include antibodies that protect an organism from infection, and hormones that send important signals throughout the body.\n\nThe proteome is the entire set of proteins produced or modified by an organism or system. Proteomics enables the identification of ever-increasing numbers of proteins. This varies with time and distinct requirements, or stresses, that a cell or organism undergoes.\n\nProteomics is an interdisciplinary domain that has benefited greatly from the genetic information of various genome projects, including the Human Genome Project. It covers the exploration of proteomes from the overall level of protein composition, structure, and activity, and is an important component of functional genomics.\n\nProteomics generally denotes the large-scale experimental analysis of proteins and proteomes, but often refers specifically to protein purification and mass spectrometry. Indeed, mass spectrometry is the most powerful method for analysis of proteomes, both in large samples composed of millions of cells and in single cells."

        "input": "",
        "output": "Most of the beer we all drink is made from the same four ingredients; barley, water, hops and yeast.The basic idea is to extract the sugars from grains (usually barley) so that the yeast can turn it into alcohol and CO2, creating beer. \n\nIn order for barley to be made into beer, it must first be malted. The malting process renders the grain usable to the brewer. It's basically taking a live seed, steeping it in water and tricking it into thinking it's time to grow.\" The grain starts to ready itself to grow into a plant but the germination is then stopped by drying the barley. Malting helps to create the enzymes necessary to convert the starches present in the seeds into sugars. Without malting, the beer would not have enough sugar content to properly ferment.\n\nThe malted barley is crushed or milled and then soaked in warm water in order to create a sugar solution known as wort. Any other grains used in the brewing process are also added at this point. Soaking the grains in warm water helps to further convert the starches into the sugars necessary for fermentation.\n\nThe wort is then moved to a copper pot and boiled. During boiling, some of the water in the wort evaporates, leaving behind a higher concentration of sugars. Boiling also helps to sterilize the mixture in preparation for fermentation. \n\nAfter boiling, the solid hops and grain are removed, and the mixture is cooled. The brewers then add yeast to this mixture. Fermenting with yeast is what makes beer alcoholic. The time it takes to ferment a beer varies based on type of yeast and style of fermentation, but most beers take about a week to ferment.\n\nDifferent strains of yeast and different fermentation techniques determine what kind of beer is being made and how it will taste. For example, when making a lager, the yeast ferments at the bottom of the wort at a cooler temperature. Ales are made with a different strain of yeast, and top fermented at warmer temperatures. After fermentation, the beer is then cooled again before bottling or canning."

        "output": "Over the past few years, electric vehicles have gained traction amongst the public for different reasons. There are though, some challenges, that can reduce the speed of adoption. The following are some of the concerns associated with electric vehicles:\n    \n1. Higher upfront cost: Electric cars are generally more expensive to acquire than gasoline-powered cars, although this gap is narrowing. But, electric vehicles are typically cheaper to run and maintain. At this stage, they have achieved parity for the total cost of ownership.\n2. Increased charging times: New electric cars can get to 80% of their range in less than half an hour when using fast charging stations, but that still slower than their combustion engine counterparts and many charging stations have lower speeds.\n3. Limited charging infrastructure: Despite the expansion of electric vehicle charging facilities, their availability remains less extensive than that of gas stations. Consequently, careful trip planning may be necessary to guarantee access to charging stations when required.\n4. Less range: New electric cars typically have a range of around 230-320 miles, which is still less than most of the combustion engine vehicles.\n5. Reduced number of options: Given the relatively new interest from car manufacturers, fewer alternatives are available for individual use cases. It should still take a few years before the offering is similar."

        "output": "If you want to increase your output on a Peloton ride there are definitely a few tips and tricks to follow to ensure progress. First off, I would always recommend using the same official Peloton equipment (Peloton Bike or Peloton Bike+) to ensure you are tracking consistent metrics between your rides. I would also recommend doing a Functional Threshold Power Test (FTP Test), to get a baseline of your maximum performance as well as get a power meter for each of your rides. From there, a big amount of increasing your power comes from consistency of both riding frequency as well as consistency in overloading your leg muscles during those durations. Taking Power Zone rides (PZE, PZ, PZMax) or Power Zone programs is a great way to increase your output over time. These rides/programs are tailored to your max level of effort, and as you progress over time, so will your 7 power zone levels. Besides consistently riding and keeping track of your metrics/FTP, there is a quick trick for increasing your output which is not that sustainable. The trick is to ride out of the saddle and crank the resistance all the way up (75+). If you can move your legs at 50+ cadence and over say an 80 resistance, you will be putting up over 300 output. If you can sustain that for a minute at a time and do that 3-5 times during a ride, you will easily increase your total output. Lower cadence is not ideal for increasing your power from a longevity strategy, but is a quick answer for breaking a personal record. Good luck on your future rides, and don't forget to send love with some highfives!"

        "instruction": "Why are there so many rules about table manners?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Well one big reason is that eating among other people is a social activity. In any social activity, there are guidelines for behavior. Mostly these guidelines are intended to make the social activity pleasant or fun for all the people involved. \nFor table manners, the rules are noticeably different among different cultures. Still, there are some common themes across cultures, for what is considered polite manners while eating. One common theme is to ensure that every person at the meal gets to eat. You can see this in the American table manner rule that nobody should not start eating until every person has been served their meal. In Mexican culture, any child who is nearby an outdoor party should be offered some of the party food. Another common theme about manners is that you should enjoy the food and the company, and not appear to simply be gobbling down as much food as possible. There are a lot of negative words to describe behavior that looks like eating too much or too fast, to be considered polite: being piggish, wolfing your food, gobbling, scarfing. \nOne rule that helps enforce slow eating, in American table manners, is that you shouldn't butter a whole piece of bread before eating it. Instead, you should tear the bread into smaller pieces, and butter only the piece you will eat next. Breaking the bread in half is considered a minimum level of politeness. Also, it's considered polite to leave one bite of each dish on your plate. If you eat everything, it could signal that you were just hungry, and eating everything available! But if you leave one bite, it signals \"I liked it, but had enough\". Americans also slow down eating by using both their fork and their knife in their right hands. This means that whenever you need to cut your food, you have to put down your fork, pick it up in your left hand, and pick up your knife in your right hand to cut your food. Before taking the bite, you have to do the opposite: put down your knife, pick up your fork in your right hand, and take your bite. This slows down eating a lot. (This rule is in contrast to table manners for the English, who keep their fork in their left hand and their knife in their right hand). Also, when eating soup, it's polite to push the spoon away from you, after filling it. Wipe the bottom of the spoon on the far side of your bowl, before bringing the spoonful of soup to your mouth. If you eat soup this way, you avoid scooping spoonfuls directly into your mouth -- which again, could look like you are just wolfing down food as fast as possible, instead of enjoying each mouthful.\nThere are also some table manner rules that provide signals to the servers or the waitstaff, without requiring verbal communications. For example, if you put down your fork pointing at 4:00 (with the handle pointing to the lower right of your plate), then it communicates \"I'm still eating\". But if you put your fork down, pointing at 10:00 or 11:00, then it communicates \"I'm finished with this food\". Then your server can take away your plate without interrupting the group conversation, which again is an example of making the social activity more pleasant for the participants. \nOverall, the rules of table manners evolved to make the social experience of eating a meal together a pleasant experience for everyone."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The normalization of deviance was a term coined by the sociologist Diane Vaughan who participated in the review of the Challenger disaster.  It was later the the subject of a number of public talks by astronaut Mike Mullane.  The theory is essentially that when we accept deviations from an expected standard, the deviation becomes the standard.  In the Challenger disaster, engineers kept noticing rubber o-rings that came back from tests in an out of tolerance state.  Because there were no dramatic failures during the tests, the engineers adjusted the standard for the o-rings to absorb these abnormalities.  Unfortunately, by normalizing deviance from the expected standard, it led to an o-ring failing during the Challenger launch, and the Challenger shuttle disintegrated in flight.  The normalization of deviance is an important pitfall to avoid when running any organization, but especially those which put its members in high risk situations, such as space travel.  To avoid it, you must remember, or learn, how and why certain standards were developed and adhere to them, even when pressures are high."

        "output": "Cockney rhyming slang is most closely associated with East London in England. It dates back to the 19th century. \n\nIt works like this:\n\nA word or phrase is replaced by another word or phrase that rhymes with it. For example instead of saying the word \"face\" you would say \"boat race\". The rhyming phrase is often longer than the original word and so the rhyme gets abbreviated. In our example \"boat race\" becomes \"boat\". \n\nSo a sentence might become \"you should have seen the look on their boat\" instead of \"you should have seen the look on their face\". \n\nAnother example might be \"I'm off up the apple and pears to go to me Uncle Ned\" - \"I'm going upstairs to go to bed\"."

There are numerous reasons why being childfree is trending. The decision to have a child comes with responsibilities and many couples do not want to embrace it. Some couples avoid the idea of having children based on past experience in the family or simply because not having a child opens new avenues to explore and spend time doing other meaningful things in life. Unwillingness to bear the financial burden of raising a child is another reason why some couples avoid the idea.\n\nNevertheless, the trend represents the rise in deterioration of interpersonal relationships. It prevents overpopulation and indirectly impacts events like recession, inflation, global warming etc. and in a consumer centric world the resonance of this trend cannot be ignored in the global economy."

Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it is an abrasive that aids in removing dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Owing to differences in composition and fluoride content, not all toothpastes are equally effective in maintaining oral health. The decline of tooth decay during the 20th century has been attributed to the introduction and regular use of fluoride-containing toothpastes worldwide. Large amounts of swallowed toothpaste can be toxic. Common colors for toothpaste include white (sometimes with colored stripes or green tint) and blue.\n\nUsefulness\nToothpastes are generally useful to maintain dental health. Toothpastes containing fluoride are effective at preventing tooth decay. Toothpastes may also help to control and remove plaque build-up, promoting healthy gums. A 2016 systematic review indicated that using toothpaste when brushing the teeth does not necessarily impact the level of plaque removal. However, the active ingredients in toothpastes are able to prevent dental diseases with regular use.\n\nIngredients\nToothpastes are derived from a variety of components, the three main ones being abrasives, fluoride, and detergent."

The answer depends on your interests (or possibly the interests of the person advising you).   \n\nSnow lovers:  if you count down the days until the mountain resorts open up, Winter is the time for you.  Most resorts open around Thanksgiving and typically close in mid-late Spring.  Tahoe has several world-class ski resorts; with Northstar and Palisades being favorites on the North shore, and Heavenly Mountain being the favorite on the South Shore.   If flying down the mountain isn't appealing, you can go sledding, snowshoeing or snowmobiling.  The snow capped mountains reflected on the deep blue waters of Tahoe make for epic winter sights.  There's plenty of joy to be had staying inside, cozying up by the fireplace and simply enjoying the peaceful scenery outside your windows.   \n\nSun Lovers:  Tahoe Summers are for you.  The Lake: beaches, marinas, restaurants, music and people galore.   The lakeside vibe on Tahoe's beaches is casual and fun.  Boaters & sailors highly regard Tahoe's famous blue waters.  Tahoe is a kayaker's paradise with so many stunning coves to explore.  Venture over to Emerald Bay to see where the lake turns from blue to green & visit the historic island in the middle.   Hikers and cyclists; when the snow melts, there are countless trails to explore, including long segments of the famous Pacific Rim trail.  For those who prefer leisurely strolls, there are some spectacular walking paths right along the lake.   Floating down the Truckee River is a must-do for a frolicking day of fun. Campers love Tahoe as well, with many fun campgrounds to visit; some even within a short distance to the bustling streets of Stateline South Shore, where there are casinos, restaurants and music venues.  Golfers can rejoice on the world class course along the lake at Edgewood.  \n\nIn the transition months, the scenery is equally beautiful; and the tourist crowds are much smaller.  Some people favorite the Spring and Fall in Tahoe, simply for a more secluded, scenic mountain getaway; catching either the tail end of the snow season or the early warmth glimpses of Summer. \n\nTahoe is a year-round destination.

        "output": "In law, successor liability is liability (debt or other obligation) that is inherited by a successor entity after a corporate restructuring. Here, \u2018successor\u2019 refers to the entity that exists after the restructuring. \u2018Restructuring\u2019 refers to any action that alters the identity or character of a business entity (e.g. a merger). Successor liability is a subset of the law governing corporate liability or liability of legal persons.\n\nA legal person is any person that can do the things a human person is able to do in law \u2013 such as enter into contracts, sue and be sued, own property, and so on. Depending on the jurisdiction, entities such as corporations, other types of firm, partnerships and state-owned enterprises may be treated as legal persons, with both rights and responsibilities under law. Successor liability rules influence how these rights and responsibilities vis-a-vis others are influenced by corporate restructurings.\n\nUnder corporate law (or possibly other bodies of law, such as employment or environmental law), some countries regulate how liability passes from a \u2018predecessor\u2019 entity to a 'successor' entity in the event of such corporate restructurings as a name change, merger or acquisition, division or dissolution. Following such restructurings, successor liability rules determine whether and how the 'successor' or acquiring entity must assume some or all of the predecessor entity's liabilities. Product liability, environmental clean-up, employment law and criminal law are some of the areas in which successor liability may enter into play. Thus, it is an important component of the legal system that supports the structural change needed in dynamic business sectors while also protecting individual and societal interests.\n\nWhile a restructuring does not automatically give rise to successor liability, the following situations are often considered to be relevant when determining whether or not such liability exists: there is an explicit agreement between the parties on the assumption of some liabilities; the restructuring is considered to be a de facto merger; the restructuring results in the mere continuation of the predecessor\u2019s business; and the transaction underpinning the restructuring was fraudulent and used to escape liability.\n\nWithout successor liability, a business entity may avoid liability by reorganising itself or otherwise altering its corporate identity. A comparative law study of successor liability in the context of enforcement of laws criminalising foreign bribery shows that countries have adopted widely different approaches to successor liability in a criminal law context. In some jurisdictions, it is not clear whether successor liability exists at all, opening up the possibility that even minor business reorganisations could 'wipe the slate clean' from the standpoint of criminal law enforcement. Other countries have comprehensive statutory frameworks that address successor liability. Still others rely on established jurisprudence or other legal principles as the legal foundation for successor liability."

        "input": "",
        "output": "In finance, a derivative is a contract that derives its value from the performance of an underlying entity. This underlying entity can be an asset, index, or interest rate, and is often simply called the \"underlying\". Derivatives can be used for a number of purposes, including insuring against price movements (hedging), increasing exposure to price movements for speculation, or getting access to otherwise hard-to-trade assets or markets.\n\nSome of the more common derivatives include forwards, futures, options, swaps, and variations of these such as synthetic collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps. Most derivatives are traded over-the-counter (off-exchange) or on an exchange such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while most insurance contracts have developed into a separate industry. In the United States, after the financial crisis of 2007\u20132009, there has been increased pressure to move derivatives to trade on exchanges.\n\nDerivatives are one of the three main categories of financial instruments, the other two being equity (i.e., stocks or shares) and debt (i.e., bonds and mortgages)."

Most parking garages at apartment complexes are located underground; however, some are above-ground.  Once I've determined where the parking garage is, I would exit my apartment by opening the door, stepping out into the hallway, and then locking the door, and then walk down the hallway in the direction of the elevator or stairs.  I would take the elevator or stairs to the appropriate floor and then exit into the parking garage.  I'm probably in the parking garage because I'm going to my car, so the next step would be to locate my car.  One trick for locating a car in a parking garage is to click the alarm or door lock button on your car's remote to make a sound."

For example, statistics have shown that over 74% of US pet owners have a dog, in comparison with 47% owning a cat. \nThe reason for their popularity has to come down to their personality. Commonly, dogs are very social and affectionate creatures who enjoy spending time with their owners. Whereas, cats tend to be more independent animals by nature, and although they also require the attention of their owner, the majority prefer to keep to themselves. This stereotypical difference in behaviour is usually the main factor determining the popularity of these pets among people."

        "output": "Answer 1: Happiness is not only subjective but also temporal - what brought you joy 2 years ago might be boring/unpleasant now. So, instead of optimizing for happiness at a given time, it might actually be better to realize what makes us feel down or not content and avoid them. By avoiding such circumstances/conditions, we can be content and maybe that's what need in life: not strive to be happy all the time but avoid what we truly don't like so that happiness takes care of its own.\n\nAnswer 2: Yes! Life is too short to get caught in dull moments so a human needs to optimize for maximum happiness. The definition of happiness differs and that's ok; we all live once and we should spend our time looking for new things that make us happier.\n\nAnswer 3: No. Most meaningful lessons in life are learned in situations when we're not particularly happy: Loss of a close person, financial break downs, unexpected health conditions. Getting through these hard times is actually makes a person stronger and more prepared for other calamities in life. We should not strive to be happy \"all the time\" -  instead we should take things as they come. In life, there is a need for moments of discontent as well as a need for moments of joy."

Roosevelt, and George Washington are most often listed as the three highest-rated presidents among historians. \nMore recent presidents such as Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton are often rated among the greatest in public opinion polls, but generally do not rank as highly among presidential scholars and historians. \nBecause William Henry Harrison and James A. Garfield both died within their first year in office, they are often omitted from presidential rankings. Zachary Taylor died after serving as president for only 16 months, but he is usually included. In the case of these three presidents, it is not clear whether they received low rankings due to their actions as president or because each was in office for such a limited time that they did not accomplish much."
