        "instruction": "What were different decades in the 1800s like?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Well, pop culture is a big definer for a time period in my opinion, and Gothic fiction was a bit of pet hobby of mine. So..\n\nThe first Gothic novels were published in the mid-1700s, and the genre exploded. And with that explosion of popularity came a lot of repetitive derivative works, trying to capture that supernatural vibe. This is furthered because we have penny presses like *Penny Dreadful* shoot out, which are really cheaply published serial literature. Some of these were just reprints of previously published works. \n\nHowever, the more memorable works of Gothic fiction are really from the 1800s. In the early 1800s, we can start getting published works that are parodies of Gothic literature. An example of a famous parody work would be Jane Austen's novel *Northanger Abby* (published 1818, written 1799-1800), which is hilarious by the way.\n\n*Frankenstein,* 1818, a novel about reanimating the dead by Mary Shelly  \n*The Vampyre,* 1819, first published vampire short story by John Polidori.  \n\nAt this same time period there is a lot of Gothic fiction with an Orientalism theme. I can't think of good example right now, but the villains will be from the East, the Orient, Africa. Scarabs will be mentioned or they own a monkey and do some magic. The occult is a massive topic of interest. Not all Gothic fiction is defined by this, as this sort of fixation on the \"other\" seems to just stretch into a lot of the genre at the same time, but a lot of the early 1800s from what I can remember had this. A lot of Chinese goods were being imported at the time. Remember, the massive trade imbalance was a main reason behind push to sell opium to China and the Opium Wars (1st: 1839-42; 2nd: 1856-60). \n\nBy the 1830s Edgar Allen Poe is publishing some poetry and his first short stories, but his more famous works that you read in high school show up later, like *\"The Pit and the Pendulum\"*, published in 1842, and *The Raven* published in 1845. His work really pushed forward the horror and suspense element of the Gothic genre.\n\nPoe sadly dies, and the Bronte sisters are in the publishing Gothic literature scene, publishing in 1847 Charlotte's *Jane Eyre,* Emily's *Wurthering Heights* and Anne's much less famously known *Cathy.*\n \nBy 1872 we have sexy vampires in Joseph Le Fanu's *Carmilla.* If I remember correctly this is the first sexualized usage of vampires, but it's been awhile, so don't quote me there. However, it was over twenty years before Dracula (1897), which was heavily inspired by this novella. \n\nTherefore, by the 1880s the Gothic genre was not only well established, but it wasn't considered with as much mockery as it had been in the early 1800s in its parodies. It became a vehicle for discussing a lot of social issues and urban fears. (Especially that previously mention Orient fear, in my opinion.) And even though Charles Dickens isn't really known as a Gothic author, his works were inspired by that kind of gloom. Think *Great Expectations* (1861). So not only did Gothic literature really develop, it infected other literary genres of the time. Cool stuff, right?\n\nThe Gothic genre starts to die off by the end of the century, turning in the 20th century pulp magazines with Lovecraft. A lot of the fiction of the 1800s really helped create dark fantasy, horror, etc. \n\nAlthough I couldn't divide it all up smoothly into decades, I hope this made sense. (; \n"

        "input": "",
        "output": "Electromagnetic interference can change the voltage in long wires. To combat this problem, signals are sent by varying the *difference* in voltage between the two wires in a twisted pair. The pair of wires are twisted together so that any interference that one wire receives will also be received by the other wire, so the voltage in the two wires will be changed the same amount, which means the *difference* in voltage between the two wires will remain the same. This allows the signal to be much more resistant to the effects of interference.\n\n >  Why are there only 4 pairs of twisted wires (orange, blue, brown, green)? Wouldn't more = better?\n\nWhy do you think more would be better?\n\nA typical Cat-5 cable used for Ethernet actually uses only two twisted pairs: one \"send\" pair and one \"receive\" pair. Gigabit Ethernet uses all four pairs. Cat-5 cable is not limited to four pairs; some backbone applications use up to 100 twisted pairs.\n\nMore wires are more expensive, of course, and in most applications there isn't a need for additional twisted pairs."

Nyan doesn't make as much sense in English, and meow doesn't make as much sense in Japanese."

        "output": "Civil wars such as the Anarchy and the Wars of the Roses in English history mostly came about as a result of succession crises rather than socio-economic factors. To put it bluntly a lot of it was down to chance: the availability of a direct male heir. \n\nFor instance, the Anarchy (1136-54) occurred because the Henry I's son drowned in 1127 leaving him with a daughter, Matilda, and a nephew, Stephen who fought for the throne. Regarding usurpation, Richard II and Henry VI were deposed because they were seen as ineffective rulers in the eyes of the political community: Richard II was not good at listening to others and did not take counsel; Henry VI had always been viewed negatively (when his magnates were defending the English lands in France, he was more interested in founding religious institutions) but the emergence of a strong Yorkist faction and his mental collapse in 1453 made civil war inevitable. He was deposed again in 1461 because the Lancastrians had become weakened: military defeat, lack of leadership and the death of Henry's son meant that the Yorkist Edward IV was in a stronger position to take back the throne.\n\nI've read other historians argue that there were long-term structural problems with the English political system that made the English monarchy more prone to usurpation and civil war. I however think that short-term political factors were more important, fundamentally regarding the line of succession.\n\nAnother thing to take into account is that the usurpation of Richard II in 1399 by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke, later Henry IV, set a very important precedent. The political community had seen that deposing a king could actually work, and if necessary they were willing to enforce it again. \n\nSorry that was a bit long-winded, hope it answers your question :)"

Just as you can talk about distances between points in space, you can also talk about distances between points in time. And what's more, you can also talk about distances between points *in space and time.* If two points are at different places in space *and* at different times, then the distance between them is through both space and time.\n\nIt turns out wrapping your head around this incredibly simple and obvious \u2014 yet still surprising \u2014 idea is the fundamental key to understanding *motion.* From one, naive point of view, motion looks like things in space moving around over time. But from another, better point of view, motion is things following *trajectories through spacetime.* When you look at motion that way, a lot of things which previously made no real sense \u2014\u00a0like how it's possible for particles which decay in a very short time to seem to last much longer before decaying when they're moving \u2014 become quite obvious and clear.\n\nSo space is space and time is time \u2026 but both space and time are geometric in nature, and understanding motion depends on understanding that objects move through space and time, not just through space."

        "instruction": "Did westerners ever migrate/defect to the Soviet Union?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Indeed, this did take place, and not just to the Soviet Union - Westerners defected to many of the other countries in the Eastern Bloc (mostly East Germany), as well as the People's Republic of China, and, at times, North Korea, Cuba, and Vietnam. Some defected to non-aligned and ostensibly neutral states, such as Switzerland and [Sweden](_URL_3_). \n\nWikipedia does have a relatively comprehensive list of (most of the) defectors from Western states [here](_URL_1_), but I can provide some additional context to the list. \n\nWestern defection and migration, especially from the United States to Soviet Union, took place before the Cold War, and, historically, was largely ideologically motivated. After the establishment of the Soviet state and the end of the Russian Civil War a number of Western Communist or Socialist sympathizers saw the Soviet regime as the manifestation of the revolutionary socialist government of the workers, the kind that many yearned for at home. Some of the Western socialists traveled to the Soviet Union both to document the transformation, and, in some cases, to hopefully facilitate it. \n\nPerhaps the most famous example of such pre-WWII Western socialists is John Reed, the author of the famous book documenting the course of the establishment of the Soviet state \"Ten Days that Shook the World\". He died in Moscow in 1920, and is one of only three Americans buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.\n\nAt roughly the same time the Soviet government embarked on a program of rapid industrialization, and as part of that program invited large numbers of Western engineers, some of whom elected to stay in the Soviet Union. Later on, during the Stalin purges many of those people would end up being tried for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government and were either shot or imprisoned. Among those Westerners that came to the Soviet Union at the time were also some African-Americans, some of whom chose to stay in Soviet Union due to the racial discrimination they experienced at home (some of their [children](_URL_0_) lived their entire lives in Soviet Union as a result).\n\nDuring and after the Second World War this trend continued, with the people who either migrated (before the Cold War) or defected to the Soviet Union being either life-long Socialists or Communist sympathizers, or becoming enamored with the Soviet system [during their travels or work](_URL_2_). Some of the high-profile examples of Western defectors to the Soviet Union of that period include people like Bruno Pontecorvo and George Koval, both of whom were nuclear physicists and were involved in the Manhattan Project. Koval in particular turned Soviet sleeper agent, having officially received his Soviet citizenship prior to the war, and is credited for giving the Soviets crucial information that facilitated the development of Soviet nuclear weapons program. \n\nThe other high-profile case is that of the Cambridge Five, a ring of 4+1 (we are pretty sure about the identities of the first 4 agents, but not the fifth) British-born Soviet spies operating within various British security services during and after WWII. All of the known members were recruited as young men, playing off of either communist sympathies, or their opposition to the Third Reich (which was seen by many as the natural enemy of the Communist system), and later defected to the Soviet Union proper. Kim Philby, thought to be the initial member of the Cambridge Five, died in Moscow in 1988 at the age of 76, and has voiced his disappointment with the quality of life in the Soviet Union (especially with the way the state treated its WWII veterans), but allegedly never considered going back to the West.  \n\nAnother extremely high-profile (in retrospect at least) case of defection is that of Lee-Harvey Oswald, who professed sympathies to the Soviet regime, and claimed to have been disillusioned with the life in the United States. That said, the Soviets were reluctant to accept him at first, and only relented after he attempted to kill himself, having been refused asylum initially. Oswald, like many other defectors, was able to enjoy a lifestyle that was considered extremely luxurious by Soviet standards, and yet paled in comparison to what you'd expect in the United States, so he, like many others, regretted his choice, and returned to the United States (a non-insignificant number of defectors couldn't bring themselves to go back and committed suicide instead).   \n\nAs has been said, a lot of the later defections followed the same basic trends - people who were initially sympathetic to the Soviet regime or were Socialist activists (or members of the Communist Party of the United States), with a background in applied sciences. Most seemed to have had little actual knowledge of the situation in the Soviet Union at the time - or, rather, they held romantic views of the Soviet system, and either didn't know about, or outright dismissed the reports of state oppression, corruption, and low quality of life in the Soviet Union, even though some of them worked in intelligence agencies like the NSA. Accordingly, many ended up regretting their decision to defect later on. Anecdotally, a lot of the Soviet sympathizers, as well as some of the actual defectors, were referred to as the \"useful idiots\" in Soviet Union. The ones that seemed to have led relatively successful lives in the Soviet Union (and they seemed to have been in the minority) were mostly high-profile Soviet spies that were recruited by the Soviet intelligence agencies and were stationed in the West prior to their defections - career spies if you will. The Cohens, a husband-wife pair of American-born Soviet spies, were convicted for espionage in the States, but later exchanged for an MI-5 agent. Both remained active within the Soviet intelligence apparatus until their deaths, and their allegiance was never in doubt, which allowed them to find high-profile employment in the East (which was not the case with the majority of defectors to the Soviet Union). \n\nBy the end of the Cold War the defections from the West almost dried up, as the political climate in the United States became more tolerant, and the economic situation in the Soviet Union continued to deteriorate."

Lift is a result of air being forced over the wings, and like I said, the explanation of why airplanes fly explains the first part pretty well. Lift usually counteracts gravity and vice versa. So we're just going to talk about thrust and drag. In order for a plane to fly it has to have air moving over its wings. This means that you have to have something pushing the plane, usually a propeller or a jet engine. Once the plane starts moving air starts hitting the plane and pushing back against it. This is called drag. At lower altitudes the air is thicker so drag is higher. Climbing to a higher altitude means the engines don't have to work nearly as hard because there's less air pushing back against the plane. As a result, planes can fly faster and farther than they can at lower levels.\n\nIn addition, pilots will also climb to higher altitudes so they can fly over storms or other weather that might make it harder to fly."

The first was a lawsuit brought by Paula Jones, accusing him of sexual harassment while he was governor of Arkansas. The second was the Whitewater investigation, which was a special counsel investigation (run by Kenneth Starr) into a financial transaction the Clinton\u2019s had been involved in- but grew in scope to investigate a variety of scandals.\n\nLinda Tripp provided the information she had gotten from Lewinsky to Paula Jones\u2019 lawyers, who then put Lewinsky on their witness list. In response, Clinton took a number of illegal actions to try and cover up the relationship.\n\nKnowing that this obstruction was occurring, Tripp then informed Starr, who broadened his scope to include the coverup of the Lewinsky affair.\n\nWhen the Starr report came out, it showed that Clinton had had an affair, had lied about it under oath, and had encouraged others to lie under oath.\n\nThis formed the basis for the Articles of Impeachment, as Congress at that time felt the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice were an impeachable offense. Ultimately, the House voted to impeach on 2 of the 4 charges brought forth- that Clinton had lied to the grand jury, and that he had obstructed justice in the Jones case. In the Senate a trial was held, but neither charge received a 2/3 vote finding Clinton guilty.\n\nI provide the above context to say this- in this case, the tawdry details of Clinton\u2019s sexual behavior were made public record through the Starr Report, and brought up significant legal, constitutional issues to be wrangled with by Congress and in the public sphere, which is why the Clinton-Lewinsky affair attracted so much attention in American popular culture.

The light follows a longer path for the observer off the train than it does for the observer on the train, both observers measure the light travelling at the same speed, so the answer is that the rate at which a second happens is different. Fun complication: imagine both observers have one of our light-in-a-jar clocks. So long as neither observer accelerates, each observer will perceive the other observer as having a slower rate of time. Whichever observer accelerates first is the one who ends up having had less net time pass.\n\nNow onto GR. I'm by no means an expert on GR. I've had a professor who IS an expert on GR for a non-GR class, and it spooked me. That said, here is what I think I know about GR. GR points out 2 things: being in a gravitational field reference frame is the same as being in an accelerating reference frame, and gravity can be explained on the basis of the geometry of space. We're used to thinking that the geometry of space is fixed: parallel lines never intersect or diverge, the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180^(o). GR says that near a mass, spacetime gets bent, and those rules no longer apply in quite the same way. Think of it like being on the surface of the Earth: locally it seems flat, but if we follow two lines of longitude, which are parallel at the equator, we eventually would find the lines intersect. In GR, one consequence of this bent spacetime is that clocks move slower the deeper into a gravitational field we go. As for the local curvature of spacetime causing some sort of argument similar to the SR case, I can't tell you if the logic works. It seems kind of sketchy, but on the right track. \n\nThe big difference between SR and GR is the concept of accelerating reference frames. The \"relativity\" part of \"relativity\" comes from the prediction that in inertial (non-accelerating) reference frames, the same rules of physics always hold. Which inertial frame I pick is inconsequential. That's great for things like spaceships moving at 0.5*c* or a train moving at constant velocity. General relativity extends the ideas we build up about inertial reference frames to accelerating reference frames, like speeding up a spaceship, being in gravity, or being on a curving train. \n\nTL;DR: Mostly right, but here is a little more technical discussion of the points I'm familiar with.

A peculiar case of maintaining autonomy by compromising sovereignty to each other! Their ability to actively organize military expeditions did not go beyond the repulsion of enemies, and their fearsomeness as soldiers was more a consequence of the fact that the Swiss confederation was for most os its history a series of poor mountainous communities populated by rugged men who knew how to fight, and consequentially became a prime recruiting ground for Italian and French rulers. \n\nContrast Italy, where only some polities would consider compromising sovereignty; in the twelfth century it took decades to organize Lombard cities into a defensive league, principally because most small cities were perfectly willing to submit from the emperor if it meant they didn't have to submit to Milan. There were also attempts to forcibly unite Italian states; the Scaligeri dynasty built a powerful state centered on the city of Verona, however, the Milanese and Venetians teamed up to defeat them.

This is the difference between natural gender and grammatical gender. Natural gender is what gender you are, grammatical gender is the class the word describing you falls in to. \n\nWords that are in the same class share certain properties. for instance masculine words in icelandic tend to have the definite artice \"-inn\", often take on the suffix \"arnir\" when in plural, and all use the masculine declinitions of adjectives (i.e all blue masculine objects are \"bl\u00e1r\", whereas feminine words are \"bl\u00e1\", and neuter \"bl\u00e1tt\").  knowing the gender of a word helps you knowing how to use that word, and what other words in the language it behaves like. \n\nit also is suspected to aid with sentence processing. If you mishear or miss a part of what someone is saying to you the other words in the sentence can help you deduce what you just missed, and gender helps narrow down the possibilities. \n\nFinally it helps with language clarity and usage a bit. In english you always use \"it\" for things without a natural gender (unless you personify things like your boat). So, when talking about a mug on a table you say \"It was placed on it\". While this is easy to deduce from context it isn't instantly clear if the mug is on the table or the table on the mug. However in icelandic you would say \"Hann er \u00e1 \u00fev\u00ed\" (He is on it). The mug is masculine, and the table is neuter.

Once it loads the first part of the OS, it passes control off to the OS' bootloader which is responsible for loading up the rest of the system.\n\nIn older operating systems, like DOS, programs might make regular use of  parts of the BIOS to handle keyboard input, screen output and disk access.

Almost the whole of the argument that reading *was* always aloud in antiquity depends on a single late passage, in Augustine's *Confessions* 6.3, where Augustine describes intruding on Ambrose's reading and sitting in silence, and pondering Ambrose's motives for sitting in silence so long and wondering why he was reading to himself. This is not only a misreading of the Augustine passage, it also neglects literally dozens of much older pieces of evidence on the subject. \n\nHowever, the counter-argument wasn't put together until 1997, so if you found this in a source written before that point, the author shouldn't be censured for being wrong -- just out-of-date. [Here's part of an old thread](_URL_0_) that goes into details. As far back as we can look, there are many more references to reading that imply silent reading than those that imply reading aloud. Some of them are as explicit as the Augustine passage.

At 882 he cries, \"I will no longer keep this unspeakable story within my mouth's gate\".\n* [Euripides, *Iphigeneia at Aulis* 34ff. and 107-108](_URL_4_) - Agamemnon reads and edits a letter repeatedly, but a slave standing next to him still doesn't know its contents.\n* [Herodotos 1.123-125](_URL_3_) - Cyrus is alone, so the references to the letter \"saying\" things and Cyrus \"hearing\" them are the aural metaphor again; cf. an inscription \"speaking\" in Hdt. 8.22.\n* [Aristophanes, *Knights* 115ff.](_URL_1_) - Nikias gives Demosthenes a bundle of oracles to read, and Demosthenes is so absorbed in reading them that when Nikias asks him what they say, he says \"pour me another cup of wine\".

        "instruction": "When did the Byzantines stop thinking of Islam as a heresy, and start thinking of it as a religion?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "Alright, I'll give this a try, but note that this is by no means definitive and I won't even attempt to go beyond the seventh century; from the way I interpret the evidence, the situation in the first century of Islam was complicated enough, so I don't feel that my limited knowledge of the eighth century will add anything to the discussion. If anyone who does know about the later period is around, please do comment and add to this answer! My range of expertise is unfortunately very limited :(\n\nFirst of all, I think it is important to first qualify who a 'Byzantine' was. In fact, I personally don't use that term at all, but only 'Roman'. However, being Roman in this period meant different things to different people. Despite the 'fall' of the Roman empire that allegedly occurred in 476, the empire in the seventh century was as diverse as ever. Transcaucasian princes, Arab frontiersmen, Egyptian peasants, Berber chiefs, Roman popes, and more were all still subjects of the emperor, so I find it difficult to generalise about their beliefs. Then there is the problem of sources, since the seventh century is a particularly source-poor period - the Greek history-writing tradition literally disappeared around 630, so we have to rely on fragmentary Syriac, Armenian, and Coptic histories for the political narrative, which can occasionally be supplemented by various ecclesiastical sources, such as letters, sermons, and conciliar records. Trying to draw a coherent picture of Roman attitudes to Islam is therefore quite difficult, something that I've already pointed out in my survey of the available evidence [here](_URL_0_). This is however a fascinating question, so I'll do my best to tease out what is significant from we know currently. \n\nAs you probably know, there is a rather fierce debate on what the nature of Islam was in this period. You have already alluded to the view that Islam only took shape later, but there are many views out there and I don't think there is a consensus yet. My own view is that Islam began as an ecumenical apocalyptic movement that seized the contemporary *Zeitgeist* and, due to the complex geopolitical situation of the time, was able to achieve territorial conquest with surprising ease in the 630s and 640s; this movement then changed and solidified its stance over time, sometime between the reign of Mu'awiyah and Abd al-Malik in the late seventh century. This is however not a universal view, as others would argue that Islam already took the form we all know today by the time of Muhammad's death. Indeed, details such as when Muhammad died or when certain conquests occurred are equally debatable. This isn't strictly relevant, but I think it is important to remember that it is difficult to construct an argument when there are so many divergent views around. What follows is my interpretation, but do continue to explore this fascinating topic beyond this answer, as I am no doubt wrong about many of the things I will talk about.\n\nOne of the first deliberate mentions of Islam is found in a Roman propaganda pamphlet from North Africa written in the 630s. It was aimed at Jews living within the Roman empire and warned of a dark threat in the empire's eastern provinces:\n\n >  Justus answered and said, \u201cIndeed you speak the truth, and this is the great salvation: to believe in Christ. For I confess to you, master Jacob, the complete truth. My brother Abraham wrote to me that a false prophet has appeared. Abraham writes, \u2018When [Sergius] the candidatus was killed by the Saracens, I was in Caesarea, and I went by ship to Sykamina. And they were saying, \u201cThe candidatus has been killed,\u201d and we Jews were overjoyed. And they were saying, \u201cA prophet has appeared, coming with the Saracens and he is preaching the arrival of the anointed one who is to come, the Messiah.\u201d\n\n >  And when I arrived in Sykamina, I visited an old man who was learned in the scriptures, and I said to him, \u201cWhat can you tell me about the prophet who has appeared with the Saracens?\u201d And he said to me, groaning loudly, \u201cHe is false, for prophets do not come with a sword and a war-chariot. Truly the things set in motion today are deeds of anarchy, and I fear that somehow the first Christ that came, whom the Christians worship, was the one sent by God, and instead of him we will receive the Antichrist. Truly, Isaiah said that we Jews will have a deceived and hardened heart until the entire earth is destroyed. But go, master Abraham, and find out about this prophet who has appeared.\u201d And when I, Abraham, investigated thoroughly, I heard from those who had met him that one will find no truth in the so-called prophet, only the shedding of human blood. In fact, he says that he has the keys of paradise, which is impossible.\u2019 These things my brother Abraham has written from the East.\u201d\n\nThis is evidently an anti-Semitic account that tried to link Judaism to this new danger and aimed to reaffirm the Jews' loyalty to the weakened empire (naturally through conversion to Christianity rather than through reasoned arguments). There is a danger in trusting this source too much, but there are too many incidental and deliberate references to the Arabs' links to Judaism to dismiss this view entirely. A good example of this is the detailed account of pseudo-Sebeos the Armenian historian from the 660s (quoted in the my link above), who wasn't *that* anti-Semitic; he even portrayed a Jewish governor of Jerusalem in a rather positive way! More generally, many Jews in this period had legitimate grievances against the empire - discrimination against Jews were common in late antiquity (to call someone \u2018the Jew\u2019 was an insult, as evident in the nickname given by miaphysite Christians to a sixth-century Chalcedonian bishop, Paul \u2018the Jew\u2019), something that escalated in the seventh century. In 614 Jerusalem fell to the Persians, a crisis of faith for many that also partially emboldened some local Jews to seize the initiative. Massacres of Christians were recorded, many of which were no doubt much exaggerated by outraged Christian authors, but they probably happened, especially as the Persians were quite adroit at using the 'divide and conquer' strategy to control their new subjects. \n\nSoon however the Persians realised that they needed to reconcile with the majority of the population they now ruled, so Christianity was once again favoured and non-resident Jews banned from moving into Jerusalem. This brief moment of relative freedom was however I think rather important, as when Roman forces moved back into the region after 628 some communities were not inclined to give in quietly, such as the Jewish community in the city of Edessa. Nor were imperial forces particularly inclined to be tolerant, as emperor Heraclius ordered the forced conversion of all Jews within the empire around 632. This was a quite influential decree, since it was even recorded in a Frankish chronicle c.660, where it was remarked that the Frankish king Dagobert loyally followed the emperor\u2019s lead and did the same for Jews in his kingdom as well. To what extent this actually happened is debatable, but we are talking about perceptions here, so this at least reflected in part contemporary attitudes towards the Jews.\n\nThis also illustrates why some Jews might be angry at the empire and why the North African leaflet had to be written at a Jewish audience, if only to reassure them that Christianity was still the best thing out there and that they really should obey imperial orders to convert. But there is another angle to this, as in Arabic sources it is also attested that Islam was, at least initially, inclusive of Jews, most famously in the *Constitution of Medina*, a document preserved in later texts but is probably an original document from Muhammad\u2019s time in Medina. The Qur\u2019an is also somewhat iffy on the issue, as it criticised Christians and Jews for their beliefs in some suras but was more positive to them in others. I don\u2019t think I can untangle this conundrum, but there is at least enough evidence to argue that it is possible that Jews (and Christians) were part of the early Arab conquests. As such, a jittery Roman administration was willing to seize upon what was familiar to them, conventional rhetoric against Jews, and construct a response to the Arab conquests by framing them as something deeply connected with Judaism. Perhaps the most remarkable evidence comes not from Roman sources, but from writers in the west - the *Chronicle* of pseudo-Fredegar in Gaul (c.660) and the *Chronicle to 754* in Spain. Pseudo-Fredegar recorded that: \n\n >  Being well-read he [emperor Heraclius] practised astrology, by which art he discovered, God helping him, that his empire would be laid waste by circumcised races.\n\nThis naturally led to Heraclius deciding that he must convert the circumcised people he knew about, the Jews, to prevent this. This story is of course a later literary construction created to explain what happened in the 630s, but as we are discussing attitudes rather than reality, this fabrication is incredibly useful. A similar account, though truncated, can be found in the *Chronicle to 754*, and we can assume that both stories had a Roman origin given the two writers\u2019 familiarity with eastern affairs. From these sources, I would say that the Romans were aware that Islam was somewhat linked to Judaism, but also that it was something different, since they never explicitly described it as Judaism (the Romans definitely knew about how to differentiate between different beliefs). This is why some historians would prefer to see Islam as a movement originating from Judaism or, more likely in my opinion, to be originally a movement fully inclusive of Jews, which allowed Romans to reimagine it as something that was instead fundamentally based around Judaism, the traditional bogeyman within the empire.\n\n*To be continued...*"

So I'm actually giving a paper on exactly this question (\"'There is no Mystery about Producing a 50 Megaton Bomb': Very high-yield nuclear weapons  and the Limited Test Ban Treaty,\") at the [next History of Science Society annual meeting](_URL_0_), this November. (I'm also the guy who made the NUKEMAP that you took the screen shot of, but that's just an aside.)\n\nI have not drawn up all of my sources of this, but here's the basic gist of what I've found so far:\n\n* Khrushchev announced the bomb well before it was going to be detonated, so it was no surprise. The press was all over it. They did the standard thing they did when nuclear weapons yields were discussed and [drew lots](_URL_4_) of [pictures](_URL_3_) of what the destruction would be in comparison to other bombs.\n\n* Publicly, many experts said that it was merely a propaganda threat. They pointed out that nuclear weapons damage doesn't scale linearly with yield \u2014 it scales according to a power-to-the-third relationship (that is, the radius of any given effect roughly a number times _W_^1/3 , where _W_ is the yield). In practice this means, for example, that while the fireball of a 10 megaton weapon has a radius of 1.5 miles, the radius of the 100 megaton weapon only has a radius of 3.8 miles. So an increase of 10X in yield only resulted in an increase of 2.5X in damage. As a result, you'd be able to damage much more of an area with lots of smaller weapons than you would with one big weapon, and the physical size of the big weapons would preclude their effective use.\n\n* The press was not universally convinced by this, as an aside. My favorite response is from the [New York-Herald Tribune](_URL_1_): \"Military experts are saying that a 100-megaton bomb such as the one Mr. Khrushchev talked about\u2014one with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of TNT\u2014would be too big to be efficient. That's nice.\"\n\n* Internationally and domestically, the test series was condemned as releasing a lot of fission products and being kind of a jerky thing to do. No surprise there. \n\n* _Privately_ there were different considerations. The Kennedy Administration was not entirely sure how they wanted to respond to the bomb. They thought about condemning the fallout very harshly but were reminded that if they did that they might put themselves in a bad position the next time they wanted to test a bunch of bombs. They also were in the process of negotiating the Limited Test Ban Treaty, and Kennedy's experts were concerned that _if_ the United States wanted its own weapons in this yield class, they might not be able to make them without atmospheric testing. There was considerable anxiety that the Soviets were \"ahead\" in the area of \"very high yield\" (their term) weapons. The Atomic Energy Commission scientists assured the administration that, if they wanted to, they could make a big bomb like the Soviets did without much effort (ergo the quote in the title of my paper), and that they could probably make weapons in that range that were much more efficient and smaller _if_ they were allowed to do atmospheric testing. \n\n* The CIA and the military were not so sure that these bombs were just propaganda efforts. Until about 1965 they were worried that the Soviets were trying to make launch vehicles big enough to use them, or might use them in some kind of ABM or EMP style weapon. Around 1965 or so they came to the conclusion that the Soviets weren't pursuing them after all.\n\n* As an aside, in 1962 the US held its last atmospheric test series. Several of those tests were of radical new H-bomb designs (test [Pamlico](_URL_2_) in particular was cited as this) that allowed brand new ways forward for weapons design. Specifically, it allowed the USA to make very compact H-bombs that could be fitted onto MIRVs and SLBMs without too much difficulty. (Exactly what these innovations consisted of is still classified, but the term they liked to use was \"radiation engineering\" \u2014 so probably the use of non-spherical primaries and spherical secondaries in very efficient configurations.) Anyway, this inaugurated a completely new approach to the design of the US strategic arsenal which was implemented over the course of the 1960s through the 1980s \u2014 one that emphasized smaller warheads on more numerous delivery vehicles, a very different direction from the kinds of very-big-bombs they had been pursuing in the 1950s.

        "input": "",
        "output": "There really is not that much known of pre-Chinese culture in Japan, simply because the earliest written records of Japan are from Chinese sources beginning in 57 CE. Known as Wa (a Japanese pronunciation of an early Chinese name for Japan), it was described by early historians as being a land of hundreds of scattered tribal communities. Third-century Chinese sources reported that the Wa people lived on raw vegetables, rice, and fish served on bamboo and wooden trays, had vassal-master relations, collected taxes, had provincial granaries and markets, clapped their hands in worship (something still done in Shinto shrines), had violent succession struggles, built earthen grave mounds, and observed mourning. \n\nThe Kofun period (ca. 250-ca. 600 CE) takes its name, which means old tomb, from the culture's rich funerary rituals and distinctive earthen mounds. The mounds contained large stone burial chambers, many of which were shaped like keyholes and some of which were surrounded by moats. By the late Kofun period, the distinctive burial chambers, originally used by the ruling elite, also were built for commoners.\n\nDuring the Kofun period, a highly aristocratic society with militaristic rulers developed. Its horse-riding warriors wore armor, carried swords and other weapons, and used advanced military methods like those of Northeast Asia. Evidence of these advances is seen in funerary figures (called haniwa; literally, clay rings), found in thousands of kofun scattered throughout Japan. The most important of the haniwa were found in southern Honshu--especially the Kinai Region around Nara--and northern Kyushu. Haniwa grave offerings were made in numerous forms, such as horses, chickens, birds, fans, fish, houses, weapons, shields, sunshades, pillows, and male and female humans. Another funerary piece, the magatama, became one of the symbols of the power of the imperial house.\n\nThe Kofun period was a critical stage in Japan's evolution toward a more cohesive and recognized state. This society was most developed in the Kinai Region and the easternmost part of the Inland Sea (Seto Naikai), and its armies established a foothold on the southern tip of Korea. Japan's rulers of the time even petitioned the Chinese court for confirmation of royal titles; the Chinese, in turn, recognized Japanese military control over parts of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe Yamato polity, which emerged by the late fifth century, was distinguished by powerful great clans or extended families, including their dependents. Each clan was headed by a patriarch who performed sacred rites to the clan's kami to ensure the long-term welfare of the clan. Clan members were the aristocracy, and the kingly line that controlled the Yamato court was at its pinnacle.\n\nMore exchange occurred between Japan and the continent of Asia late in the Kofun period. Buddhism was introduced from Korea, probably in 538 CE, exposing Japan to a new body of religious doctrine. The Soga, a Japanese court family that rose to prominence with the accession of the Emperor Kimmei about 531 CE, favored the adoption of Buddhism and of governmental and cultural models based on Chinese Confucianism. But some at the Yamato court--such as the Nakatomi family, which was responsible for performing Shinto rituals at court, and the Mononobe, a military clan--were set on maintaining their prerogatives and resisted the alien religious influence of Buddhism. The Soga introduced Chinese-modeled fiscal policies, established the first national treasury, and considered the Korean Peninsula a trade route rather than an object of territorial expansion. Acrimony continued between the Soga and the Nakatomi and Mononobe clans for more than a century, during which the Soga temporarily emerged ascendant.\n\n- Japan: A Country Study. Ronald E.

A lot of recent historiography, has demonstrated otherwise.  \n\nWhich means in one region like England you might have vassalage, but you wouldn't have fragmentation of authority.  In another like France you might have the opposite, with a weak state but simultaneously weak binds of reciprocal military loyalty.  Even within France you would have many subregions where each one would have or not have aspects of this fairly broad definition.  This of course, not even counting the fact that feudalism as a system for a long time was assumed to span the full thousand years between the fall of the western empire and the renaissance, which increased its variability, as well as it possibly being a global system, (where the variability would go off the charts).\n\nSo with these caveats in mind, let me get back to your question.  Keep in mind most of the below, only really works for the area under the Carolingian Empire.  And even then, it's mostly about France.\n\nProper land ownership, like the late roman latifundium, even in the middle ages was very specific.  It was land which was owned in full.  The person could do whatever he wanted with it, and did not need to pass any of the profits from it anywhere else.  However, latifundium were not exactly vast, because of the full title to it.  It tended to be owned in patchworks, at least in the early medieval era.  A modern analogy would be, imagine a movie star with 10 houses all across California, clustered in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego.  He owns a lot of houses, some in the same city, but they're not connected.\n\nNow aside from land ownership, there was this concept of jurisdiction, which is what you have control over as an officer of a higher (royal) authority.  As you can probably surmise, people who are royal officers will probably have larger and more cohesive jurisdictions than what property they actually own.  After all, in many ways, having control of land was as good as owning land.  In a modern analogy, it's like the difference between you owning a car as a sole owner of a business, vs you driving the company car as the CEO of your business.  Only in the former do you \"own\" the car, but is your available usage of that car any different in the latter?  These were what the early medieval counts were.  It wasn't a landed title like we imagined it was later, it was an office as a representative of the king, who was imbued with certain powers to try local justice, give directives on behalf of the king, and raise the local militia.  Although with that said, these officers used their positions to their advantage, sometimes to secure local land and power themselves, and this would play a major factor in the future fragmentation of early medieval state authority.  However at this time, these are just offices, and the problem of any office, is that you can be fired from it.\n\nBTW dukes, were traditionally a different sort of office from counts.  Dukes were military leaders who lead the regional army.  So whereas the counts wereat only the local representative, and could only raise the militia, dukes were in charge of all the military forces of many counties.\n\nFlash forward to the 10th century, after the collapse of Charlemagne's empire.  There's no central authority anywhere.  All that's left is local authority.  Now the land you used to properly own no longer matters as much as what you have jurisdiction over.  Because there's no one to remove you from your jurisdiction, that land is as good as yours now.  With no one firing officers from their posts, it is in your interest to keep the power within the family, i.e. hereditary.  \n\nIn modern terms, think of it as a transition from a small corporate office to a family business.  In a corporate office, people can be replaced and will no longer have power once removed.  But in a family business, just because you've fired your dad as CEO, does not mean he's not your dad anymore.  True you no longer have to deal with stranger bosses who don't care whether you have a job or not, but now you gotta deal with your nutjob family that you have to live with outside of work.  Thus the crazy dramatic medieval world we've come to know and love.\n\nOriginally, in the chaos of 10th century, even though dukes were regarded as \"higher\" than counts, it was not really a formalized system where dukes were in charge of counts who were in charge of barons, a la Crusader Kings.  More it was the size of the territory you claimed ownership/jurisdiction over, as well as regional language preferences, dictated what you felt comfortable claiming.  Thus a person who controlled what used to be the jurisdiction of 5 massive counties in southern France, decides to call himself a duke.  Someone who only controlled one county, decides to keep calling himself a count to not look foolish.  Someone who was in charge of a border province, a \"march\" calls himself a marchess, or \"marquis\".  But in reality, all of these titles mean nothing except for bluster, as everyone is essentially a petty king at the moment.  The only reason they don't call themselves a king, is because of a lingering respect for the office, and an expectation that one has to have control over the historic kingdom area to be called a king.\n\nWhere the formalization of rank comes, is much later, once the european kingdoms stabilize and begin recentralizing, which is about the late 13th century.  By now kings are flexing their muscle, they've probably defeated or forced to swear loyalty to them many of the formerly autonomous dukes and counts, thus they can safely reduce the positions of these essentially \"petty kings\" to just titles.  Thus a count represents the noble of one area of land, a duke over several counts.  But rest assured, this is only because the king grants them that limited jurisdiction.  He now, is monopolizing full jurisdiction under himself, and thus the modern state slowly begins forming.\n\nAnd because the kind of near-owned jurisdictional control of the earlier medieval era is gone, private property comes back into play, and land ownership begins (mostly) functioning like it does now.  \n\nHope this answers your question."

Some species can cause an infection from just a couple of bacteria; others can need hundreds (or more!) in order to reliably infect a host.\n\nScientists who study infectious diseases even have a metric to describe this particular property of a given bacterial species or strain. They measure both the ID50 (the number of bacteria required to cause an infection in 50% of exposed hosts, also called the \"Infectious Dose\") and the LD50 (the number of bacteria required to cause a FATAL infection in 50% of exposed hosts, also called the \"Lethal Dose\"). These vary widely between different kinds of bacteria; for example, the LD50 in mice is a few thousand bacteria for salmonella, but less than ten for the bacterium that causes bubonic plague.\n\nOf course, the number of bacteria needed to cause an infection also depends to some extent on the host. Generally, people with robust immune systems are more difficult to infect than immunocompromised patients (kids, the elderly, AIDS patients, people on immunosuppressive therapy, etc.).\n\nOne word of caution: bacteria are really small -- you can fit a whole lot of them (like more than a million) in a teaspoonful of cookie dough. So you can limit the amount of batter you're ingesting, but it might not work to prevent you from getting sick, since you don't know how many bacteria are in each spoonful of batter.

        "output": "That's a good question. K and Na are indeed chemically almost indistinguishable. But your doubt is misplaced - size is in fact exactly how they're distinguished in living things. \n\nTo take potassium channels as an example (since I know the structure of that one offhand), it consists of four 'cubes' stacked on each other. If you imagine each cube having an oxygen atom in each corner (from the C=O carbonyl oxygen of the _backbone_ of amino-acid chains). \n\nThese 'cubes' have just the right size so that the positive potassium ions can coordinate to all eight corners of the 'cube' ([side view](_URL_0_), note this picture is somewhat misleading - at most two 'cubes' at a time are occupied, not all four). The smaller sodium ion, on the other hand, can only bind to two or three corners (IIRC). \n\nSo if you imagine a K^+ or Na^+ ion in solution such as the cytosol, it is solvated - that is, coordinating to a group of water molecules around it. To enter the ion channel, it must break those intermolecular bonds, which requires energy. By coordinating to the oxygen atoms of the channel, some of that energy is recouped. But since potassium coordinates to more oxygen atoms, its energy is lowered more by that than sodium's is. So it requires more energy for a sodium ion to enter (and ultimately pass through) the channel than it does for a potassium ion, which makes it statistically improbable a sodium ion will do so. \n\nAlthough simple, this mechanism is still pretty remarkable, since the difference in size between the ions is not that great, and because proteins tend to have a bit of flexibility. But if you look at the structure of the K channel, it is pretty tightly bonded with lots of intermolecular bonds holding the amino acid chains in place, making it rigid. The aforementioned fact that it's the carbonyl oxygen atoms on the amino acid backbone, rather than a polar side-chain (e.g. glutamate), is also significant, as the side-chains are usually able to move about more.\n\n"

        "input": "",
        "output": "Well this subreddit has a 20-year rule on discussing history, so anything past '93 is taboo.  However, a basic history can be discussed in that time frame.\n\nIsrael first \"got\" the territories after the 1967 war, in addition to the Sinai peninsula.  The Golan is somewhat different than the others, in ways I'll outline below.  The West Bank and Gaza were the parts of the British Mandate of the area that wasn't won by Israel in their war of independence.  However, despite the original plan to divide the area into Jewish and Arab states, the West Bank and Gaza were occupied by Jordan and Egypt, respectively, with puppet governments at first.  The Sinai was returned to Egypt after the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt in the 70s.  The Golan wasn't part of the British Mandate for Palestine, but was part of Syria conquered in the war.\n\nEarly in Israel's history (pre- and post-state), there was a strong drive to develop new areas and establish a Jewish population.  There were a few reasons for this:\n\n* To make areas solidly Jewish for future agreements.  This applied pre-state, and was successful in the southern desert\n* To fortify areas against foreign expansion.  There was a fear that nearby countries would kinda creep into areas that weren't settled, which did happen in one important case, along the Sea of Galilee.\n* To provide fortification in the event of war.  Small *kibbutzim*, collective farms, had significantly delayed or halted Egyptian advances during the war of independence, and putting cities in bordering areas meant that armies invading would have to fight through cities constantly\n* To develop new areas for habitation.  This was especially a concern in areas that were there weren't cities, such as the southern desert, and swamps earlier on.  This was especially important considering the massive immigration to Israel.\n* To take some of the attacks from the central areas.  Border towns would get the brunt of incursions and attacks, which were common between wars.  This protected the larger cities in the center of the country\n\nThat attitude essentially continued after the war, which led to settlement.  The additional reason was that the West Bank is the historical Jewish heartland.  Many of the cities were major Jewish ones in the past, and having Jews there again was desireable ideologically.  There wasn't much against it, either.  Israelis saw the territories as conquered fair-and-square from a defensive war, and didn't really worry about the Palestinians now stuck in limbo.  Contemporary Palestinian nationalism was far less compromising than today, so settlements in the WB weren't much worse with regard to that than the rest of Israel.\n\nThis led to government encouragement of settlement of the territories.  Some moved in for ideological reasons, but for most it's economic.  Land is cheaper there, and parts of the West Bank are quite close to major Israeli cities (Israel is unbelievably small.  It's often difficult for Westerners to see just how small.  From a tall building in several coastal cities you can see both the West Bank and the ocean.  You could walk across pre-67 Israel).  The term \"settlement\" evokes temporary clusters of people, but the vast majority of \"settlers\" live in regular-looking cities.  The ideological settlers do have some tiny temporary towns.\n\nThe Sinai was returned to Egypt, and the few settlements within were dismantled.  The Golan was quasi-annexed.  It has a much smaller non-Jewish population than the other territories, and the Druze who live there, while pro-Syria, seem largely content with being Syrian residents of Israel.\n\nThat was essentially the status quo until the First Intifada, the first major Palestinian uprising.  Without going into ridiculous detail, the conclusion was the Oslo Accord.  The results included:\n\n* Agreement of Israel to Palestinian autonomy\n* Agreement of the PLO to settlement of some sort with Israel (what they agreed to is somewhat unclear, but it was a major step)\n* The basic principle of \"land for peace\".\n\nThis meant that removing the settlements was a useful bargaining chip for Israel, rather than a pointless thing.  Note that these were controversial at first among Israelis, but eventually became the mainstream view, even among hawks.  So removing settlements became reasonable.  This is about as far as I can go with this subreddit's 20-year rule.\n\nSo the result is that, for quite a while, Israel has been willing to remove at least some settlements.  But doing so is difficult politically (they're kicking people out of their homes, after all), so Israel generally wants some sort of concession from the Palestinians before doing so.  Though far-left Israeli political parties have been in favor of immediate removal of the settlements, that's not a mainstream view.  The mainstream view has long been that removing them is a possibility as a part of negotiations.\n\nedit: To answer your questions directly, they've always been somewhat controversial internationally, since they're on occupied territory.  Domestically, there's been objections from the start, but they only became significantly controversial within Israel when negotiations began.  Still, the mainstream Israeli political view is that their growth should be frozen and some should be removed as part negotiations, not because they're somehow wrong.\n\nNote that there is still significant Israeli opposition to removing settlements.  But even many hawks think it's an acceptable possibility."

They try to assist each other in ways they can in return for the hope that those they help will help them in their own time of need. This is basic altruism. These people create a \"Sovereign\", be it a King, an elected Government, an Emperor and Senate, Tribal Chieftan, or whatever. Furthermore, the contract requires some rights be given up (stuff we wouldn't consider to be rights, but technically are, such as the right to murder, the right to steal, etc), and some rights are transferred to the Sovereign and taken from the people: (ie, the State can kill without repercussion because it does so for the good of the Contract, taxation, imprisonment, etc). The latter is because the Sovereign is the embodiment of the People's Will, and so has possession of those rights which could be abused by individuals but cannot (without revolution) by Sovereigns.

        "input": "",
        "output": "It is true that anything the slave owned would have belonged to the master. Technically, the head of the family, the *paterfamilias* had the power over all the possessions of the people in his househould, under his *potestas*, excluding the wives' dowry (that is in a traditional *manus*-marriage, there were other forms of marriage that kept the possessions of both partners separate). So he was the sole legal owner of any and everything his wive, sons, daughters and slaves possessed until the time they left his power, since only persons who were *sui iuris*, of their own law, were able to own property. This is obviously a very unpracticable state of affairs.\n\nThe solution was not particular to slaves, but to all members of the familia who were under the power of the *paterfamilias*, and this was the concept of a *peculium*. In its original sense it is a special asset separate from other assets, in the common sense it meant those special assets that a *paterfamilias* entrusted to one of his subjects for them to work and manage, for example a small herd of animals, a building or plot of land and its profits, or a loan to run their own shop. *De jure* these assets are neither in the possession nor under the ownership of the holder of the *peculium*, their parts are still part of the assets of the owner. He or she only has *detentio*, that is the de facto possession and the ability to do with it what he wants. This has several advantages, for example it allowed sons to keep what they earned in the military (*pecunium castrense*) or through other service (*quasi castrense*); another advantage was that the master would not be liable with all his assets for the dealings that one of his slaves (or one of his profligate sons) undertook with the *peculium* entrusted to him, while still retaining possession of it; so a kind of ancient limited liability company, if you will. It also allowed the master to skim off the profits or dissolve the *peculium* at will. Since slaves were indispensable in the running of day-to-day business, this was an easy method to give them a freer hand, so they would need less control and could act on their own.\n\nThe biggest advantage in regard to slavery seems to have been that it provided a motivation for slaves to work hard for their master and profit from their own work. Varro in his treatise on agriculture, where slaves are discussed as part of the articulate tools needed to run a profitable farm, advises the farmer to give his slaves the opportunity to own some things of their own which they could profit from and use for their own goals.\n\n > They are made to take more interest in their work by being treated more liberally in respect either of food, or of more clothing, or of exemption from work, **or of permission to graze some cattle of their own on the farm, or other things of this kind**; so that, if some unusually heavy task is imposed, or punishment inflicted on them in some way, their loyalty and kindly feeling to the master may be restored by the consolation derived from such measures. [Varro, *rust.* 1.17, 7].\n\nHaving some cattle of their own to look after and profit from would have been a form of *peculium* fitting for a farm, and the word itself comes from the word for a small farm animal, *pecus*. So a slave could *de facto* have possessions of his own, even if they *de jure* belonged to his master, but there was a strong moral and economic obligation to honour this peculiar state of affairs, so it became common practice. I don't want to overstress the analogy, but in a certain sense it allowed the slave to become a share-holder in the masters enterprises, tying his economic success to that of his master. It seems obvious that this was a big motivation for the slave that was so minded to do his work well and look after his masters profits that thus became his own, in this limited way. \n\nIt also seems that the *peculium* normally stayed with the slave when he was transferred to a new master:\n\n > In the purchase of slaves, it is customary for the peculium to go with the slave [Varro, *rust.* 2.10, 5]\n\nAgain, the important word here is customary, it was all up to the disposition of the master. He retained full ownership and could withdraw the *peculium* for any reason and at any time should he be so inclined, only facing the obstacle of overcoming common practices and mores, damaging his public image (which should not be underestimated in a society where people were so preoccupied with precisely that). What I want to say by this is that your mileage may vary, and if you are a slave on some far away plantation or any other remote place, who are you going to look for to complain? \n\nBut, should the slave be freed at some point, he would also have retained possession and gained ownership of his allowance. In short, while a slave could not legally own anything, same as any other member of a household under the *pater*, there was *de facto* a possibillity to own and spend (and profit from) anything ranging from some pocket money or a small flock of sheep to a whole business operation. When Musicus Surranus, a slave of Tiberius, died some time in the 1st century, he was in possession of no less than sixteen under-slaves, or *vicarii* [see inscr. CIL VI 5197]. Slaves owning other slaves was another instrument to encourage loyalty and productiveness, and also competition among the slaves, something that might seem strange at first but makes perfect sense considering the things said above.\n\nNow, as regarding buying their freedom, the evidence seems a bit mixed. It is certainly true that slaves *could* buy their freedom, like Publius Decimius Eros Mentula, who bought his for 50,000 sesterces [CIL XI 5400] and became a great and wealthy benefactor of his home town after this. But Mouritsen has recently argued [H. Mouritsen, The Freedman in the Roman World (Cambridge 2011), see here esp. p. 177ff.] that this was less often the case than is commonly assumed. One of his arguments is that there is less literary evidence for it than we like. The other, to me more convincing one is that it made less economic sense in the special context of Roman slavery.\n\nIt is true, buying your own freedom is a common staple of slaveholder societies ancient and modern, and a common trope, the deserving slave buying his own life back after hard work. However, the Roman freedman after his manumission still was in a very deep relationship with his former master, who now became his patron. Upon gaining his freedom, the slave took on the family name of his former master and thus became a full member of the masters family (and de facto this was one of the ways to perpetuate a family). One does only need to look at the way the Tulli Cicerones treated and cared for Ciceros slave and later freedman Tiro. He truly was family to them. Cicero and his brother Quintus in their letters show great concern both for Tiros health and well-being, but also for his professional success.\n\nWhat this means is that, while the freedman still has obligations towards his patron, usually staying in his household and continuing to work for his former master in some capacity or another, the patron also has obligations to his client, to care for him and help him in times of need. Often freedmen would carry out their masters business interest, act as his authorized officers or trusted messengers and manage workshops or farms for him. Being the freedman of an important patron was an important position in and of itself, and the imperial freedmen running the emperors bureaucracy became a common trope in the 1st century. So, while it might not necessarily have served to buy his freedom directly, the *peculium* was the proof of a deserving slave, one who managed his own (and thus his master's) affairs well and worked hard, thus he was deserving of freedom. This might be where the connection between the *peculium* and manumission stems from. Simply taking back that *peculium* from the slave upon manumission would undermine that special 'social and moral bond' [Mouritsen 2011, 180] that would form the basis of their continued and important relationship, in which trust would play a very important part. \n\nOne example of a type of slaves where the buying of ones own freedom was more common were actors and doctors (like Publius Decimius mentioned above), people who could make their own living with the specialist skills they had aquired without the support of their patron. Others might have been old or infirm slaves, who thus financed their replacement in a perverse twist of business acumen. But generally, other forms of manumission (by testament or for their hard service, or simply magnamity) seem to have been more common.\n\nEdit: Added some stuff and fixed some typos/smoothed out the language a bit."

        "input": "",
        "output": "I will address your initial question with some ideological context.  I will also address your second question.  I hope someone else can help with the  other two questions you've posed!  Also, I'm sorry this is a giant wall of text!  Brevity is something I struggle with.\n\nIn R. Keith Schoppa's book *Revolution and It's Past:  Identities and Change in Modern Chinese History*, Schoppa dedicates most of a chapter to this question.  Schoppa begins with the following:\n\n > Chinese culture had always focused on the past.  Even for Confucious the golden age had been in that past, a time when society was harmonious and the country was peaceful.  The goal of statesmen throughout the centuries was to restore something of that splendid past, even though no one thought that it could ever really be done.  The past framed the present, so any change in state and society had to be rationalized in terms of that past, whether the particularly relevant past was the policies of a recent emperor or one's family traditions.\n\nI think that this is one of the obstacles that the Qing encountered in regard to westernization.  It is also worth noting that people who were part of the 'self-strengthening' movement subscribed to the idea that they could convince conservatives that Western weapons were only inanimate machines.  They were able to rationalize that the weapons were culture neutral.  They were the means by which China could protect their culture.  Schoppa argues that this logic contains a glaring fallacy:\n > Foreign machines might look culture neutral (i.e., anyone can turn a switch, pull a trigger, or pilot a ship), but they came with a host of culture-specific scientific views and worldviews.\n\nEssentially, if a young man were to begin the study of engineering and technology, that student would return to Chinese culture with a new set of worldviews.  When applied to the Chinese classics, these worldviews would provide a broader context for the content and more questions would arise.  This was a threat to the revered classics and basis for Chinese society.\n\nAnother problem encountered was the problem of the civil service exam.  Until this time, success was measured by the civil service exam.  Officials were concerned that they would not be able to attract students to the shipyard schools or arsenals because the best students trained for the civil service exam.  How would the government be able to persuade good students to apply to schools which taught concepts that were not tested on the exam.  Schoppa cites Li Hongzhang:\n > One of the measures we can take is to introduce a new category in the civil service examination, namely the category of technology.\n\nAdditionally, I have notes from a course I took on Modern China.  The professor advised that China did not have the infrastructure to maintain modernization.  I don't have more information to support this assertion unfortunately.\n\nMost of the following is sourced from Schoppa's book and that lecture I mentioned above.  This is a basic chronology of the indemnities paid by the Qing and little bit about taxes.\n\nI think that to fully understand the economic problems of the late Qing, we must start with the reign of Qianlong.  The Qing essentially took over the Ming tax system and did not reform it or reassess taxes.  One might imagine that this was a mistake.  Taxes were paid in silver taels.  Farmers would trade their crops for copper and, in turn, trade those for silver taels.  Here are some statistics regarding taxes that I find startling.  \n > During the reign of emperor Jianqing (1769-1821)  1 tael equated to 1500 copper\n > During the reign of emperor Daoguong (1821-1850) 1 tael equated to 2700 copper\n\nIn 1834 the British East India Company went bankrupt.  China traded heavily with the company.  The Opium War ensued.  It lasted from 1839-1842.  The Treaty of Nanjing signed by Great Britain and the Qing opened the ports of Canton, Ningbo, Shanghai, Xiamen, and Xenjiang.  It also relinquished Hong Kong to the British.  A total indemnity of 21 million pounds was to be paid by the Qing before 1941 in installments.  The British charged 5% interest on late payments.  \n\nAt this point, the general consensus of the public regarding taxes was \"the government doesn't help me, so I won't pay my taxes!\"  By 1864, the treasury is bankrupt.  The Tianjin massacre of 1870 ended in an indemnity to the French for 20 million taels.  The First Sino-Japanese War ended in 1895.  The Treaty of Shimonoseki established an indemnity to Japan for 200 million taels and the Qing gave up several key pieces of territory.  \n\nThe Boxer Rebellion resulted in another indemnity of 450 million taels ($333 million in 1901).  Schoppa notes that the average yearly income for the Qing at this time is only 88.2 million taels in 1901.  \n\nEventually, the Qing dissolved the ineffective Bannerman army.  Once violence erupted, they asked wealthy citizens to raise money and troops to protect the royal family.  The final straw in my opinion were the train lines.  in 1869, China had approximately 370 miles of rail lines.  The Qing needed investors for the rail lines.  Many foreign companies invested.  Specifically, Germans created shell companies to invest in the rail lines.  The fatal blow came in 1910.  The Qing decided to nationalize all of the rail in the country.  Schoppa notes that this is a last ditch effort to save themselves.  \n\nThe Qing government was not in a good economic situation near the end of the dynasty.  You can reason that individual Qing officials had wealth, but the government in general was in a very bad place economically.\nI hope this answers your question!  If you have further questions, I will try my best to answer them!"

The problem with bleed air is it has poor transmission efficiency, ie. you lose a lot of energy piping it around to different parts of the aircraft, but even the 787 uses bleed air for engine cowling anti-ice (though the rest of the aircraft is bleedless) since it's so close to the engine anyway.\n\nIf you meant the white spiral in the middle, that's to indicate to ground crew whether or not the engine is turning.

        "instruction": "At which altitude does the atmosphere become too thin to carry sound waves?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "So this comes down to the [Knudsen number](_URL_2_), which is defined as the ratio of the \"mean free path\" (the average distance a molecule can travel before colliding with another molecule in the atmosphere) versus some characteristic length scale - in this case, that would be the wavelength of the sound wave. At low pressures, if the mean free path is longer than the wavelength, sound won't transmit well.\n\nSince wavelength is what determines pitch (with deep bass notes having much longer wavelengths than high treble notes), sound would not be propagated evenly across all pitches. If you imagine that you took a slowly traveling elevator upwards, pressure starts dropping and mean free path length increases. The highest pitches are the ones with the shortest wavelengths, so they would be damped first. This would act like a low-pass filter and sound would be a bit muffled, like talking through a pillow. As you continue to ascend, lower and lower pitches would get damped out, until you heard nothing at all.\n\nA very similar question to this was asked a while ago and I did [these calculations](_URL_1_) if you want to see the math - the take away is that sounds at the upper pitch limit of hearing starts getting damped around pressures of 5 microbars, and the lower pitch limit of hearing is damped around 5 nanobars. In terms of heights above the Earth's surface, that corresponds to roughly 85 km and 135 km, respectively.\n\nNow if you're talking specifically about J. S. Bach's Flute Sonata in B minor, the highest note in that piece ([PDF here](_URL_0_)) appears to be an F# two and a half octaves above middle C (assuming this is a standard C flute). That corresponds to a frequency right around 1400 Hertz, which has a wavelength of...\n\n\u03bb = c/\u03bd\n\n= 350 m/s / 1400 s^-1 = .25 m\n\n...which would damp out at a pressure of...\n\nP = RT / (sqrt(2) * pi * d2 * N_a * MFP)\n\n= 8.3145*300K / (1.414 * 3.14 * 9e-20 * 6.02e23 * 0.25 m)\n\n= 4.1 x 10^-2 Pa = 0.41 microbar\n\n...which corresponds to a height of about 103 km altitude, coincidentally quite close to the Karman line. Bear in mind that the flute would still sound a bit odd somewhat below that altitude, as the higher harmonics of that highest F# would be damped out at somewhat lower altitudes.\n\n**TL;DR**: 103 km altitude."

        "input": "",
        "output": "So the answer to your primary question is that there were no widespread rules about minimum age of service. There may well have been local customary rules that were never written down, but we don't have access to them. It's important to remember that medieval Europe was hugely diverse in its customs and very different in many aspects from our modern ways of doing things. Medieval armies were temporary affairs, put together from what fighting men were available. They were not in any sense professional armies, and it's a matter of debate whether we can even talk about soldiers prior to the 15th century.\n\nWith that said, there seems to have been a broad understanding that post-pubescent men, not adolescents, were the proper material for war. You can find examples of boys of sixteen or seventeen engaging in battle, but it wasn't terribly common.\n\nTo your second question: in almost all cases, medieval lords did not round up the peasants every time a war broke out. I'm not sure where this myth came from, but it's dead wrong. Even in times and places where a general levy was in place (Carolingian France, Anglo-Saxon England), it seems to have only been applicable to the wealthier farmers who could provide their own weapons and equipment. From about 1000 AD, the levy decreased massively in importance, with semi-professionals taking up much of the slack. So for a typical high medieval army, you could expect to find vassals fulfilling military obligations, retinue men following their lords to war, adventurous warriors who attached themselves to some notable for the duration of the campaign, mercenaries fighting for pay, levied men from the towns and shires, but very few unwilling peasant conscripts."

        "input": "",
        "output": "The terms used in this question are often unspecific due to the variety of contexts people will use them in.  A linguistic answer would look at the problem in terms of first-language-acquisition (L1) or second-language-acquisition (L2).  Both sociolinguistics and neurolinguistics can demonstrate how these are distinct processes with very different assimilation paths.  L1s are passively assimilated in infancy and childhood, while L2s are assimilated with more difficulty and the active participation of the speaker.  Academically speaking, it has been suggested a language is living if it still has a renewable source of L1 speakers.  If the language has neither L1 nor L2 speakers, it is extinct.  If it has *nonrenewable* L1 speakers (living elders but only L2 children), then it may be considered living and endangered or essentially dead depending on the analyst.  But I would stress that this kind of distinction is relatively moot in both analysis and field research, whose primary goal is to record the language, not to preserve it.  \n\nRevitalization efforts, such as those in California for indigenous peoples who have lost their historical language in the Athabaskan or Uto-Aztecan families, rely on earlier records.  No doubt there would be a strong tendency within these groups to suggest the language still lives simply because people are trying to acquire it, but there are logical complications to suggesting true continuity here.  Recorded language is always an incomplete picture.  For example even if you had a *complete* lexicon, and a thoroughly documented grammar, the instincts the original L1 speakers would have for forming new words, for acquiring loanwords, and for nonce-words or wordplay, are likely gone.  The new L2 speakers may succeed in generating new L1 speakers if they then have children and isolate them in the L2 environment, but having skipped a generation, these L1 speakers will come to 'fill in the gaps' wherever they may exist in the imperfect L2 acquisition of their parents.  Politically their speech may be identified as Yorik or Serrano (a few extinct languages in California) and have importance within the tribe, but academically this is not the same language.  It may be more useful to look at such a case as a descendent language.  \n\nTake for example Hebrew.  Hebrew does not enjoy a continuous chain of L1 speakers from Biblical/Ancient Hebrew.  It is cited as successfully revitalized - often cited as the only such case - but modern L1 Hebrew speakers have pages and pages of their own innovations both lexically and grammatically that are influenced by other modern languages and do not descend from the structures used by the strictly liturgical Hebrew which was many people's L2, but nobody's L1.  For example native Hebrew morphology follows a root-and-pattern structure like other Semitic languages, but in modern Hebrew a growing number of words do not adopt native patterns.  This is common in areal linguistics even among 'unbroken' living languages - the morphology will often simplify or adopt innovations from neighboring languages of influence.  \n\nWhen this happens to a revitalized language, and it is inevitable that it will, the original teachers - the L2 speakers - will often perceive it as a threat and attempt to enforce conservative speech patterns on their L1 children.  This always fails for the reason language change occurs at all - newer generations have their own innovations.  In revitalized languages, they simply have *more of them* because their education could not provide for every possible situation.  \n\nTherefore there are ways in which the differences between a revitalized language and the original can be downplayed because the processes at work in those differences are common to all languages over time - but differences still remain that would make it a bad idea to consider the two stages of the language identical or continuous.  That discontinuity may ruin revitalized speakers from participating in studies where the original language was relevant.  \n\nYou will also find single instance cases of parents - for example - teaching their children Latin or Attic Greek as an L1.  In every recorded instance of this, the child has reverted back to the language or languages used in their community in all contexts except home, and as more modern vocabulary demands to be incorporated into their speech - a process L2 Latin-speaking parents can't hope to keep up with - even the home context has reduced or disappeared.  This fails for the same reason parents who teach their kids Klingon fail:  the lack of peers.  We ultimately learn language from our peers when peers are available, in preference to our parents.  If you had *a group or community* of L2 Latin speakers who all agreed to speak only Latin with their children so as to produce L1 Latin speakers again, then at best you would have the Hebrew scenario.  Is it or isn't it *really* Latin?  How much innovation makes the language a distinct form?  It'll certainly still be mutually intelligible, after all.  These are not questions linguists can answer, because they have no real bearing on study.  The old joke goes that a language is just a dialect with an army and a navy.  And speakers of the same dialect do not always share the same features - usually they share anywhere from 20-80% of the same features (a specific set of features is then called an idiolect, the speech of *one* person).  Intelligibility is often used to attempt to define a conventional language barrier, but when is a dialect a different dialect?  There's always a town on the border, after all.  "

It's a general property of mixtures that they don't necessarily have properties that are simple 'averages' of the respective pure substances.\n\nThis is possible largely because transition-metal atoms have roughly the same sizes ([check it out](_URL_0_)) and can substitute each other in the crystal lattice of the metal.\n\nWhen they do this, it fundamentally alters the material properties, because two different metal atoms bond to each other in a different way than how they bond in their respective pure metals. Not only that, but a single metal atom (say a tin atom in bronze) will affect all the (copper) atoms surrounding it, and influence how those atoms bond to _their_ neighbors. So a copper-copper bond is no longer quite the same when one of the copper atoms has a tin atom next to it, as when it only has copper atoms as neighbors. It can also affect the overall crystal structure, causing a different pattern of bonds to be favored over how it is in the pure case. \n\nThat all means that even by adding a relatively small amount of one metal to another can cause surprisingly large effects in the overall properties. Something that's very important to manufacturing computer chips (semiconductors), where the electronic properties of the semiconductor (silicon usually) are carefully manipulated by adding tiny amounts of other elements (called 'dopants').\n"

        "output": "Linked to a nice study \n\nThe gist of which, As the wave breaks on itself it generates lots of turbulence which organizes itself as a vortex. The vortices get bent perpendicular to the breaking wave and stretched back round the breaking wave as it passes over head. \n\nThis is a great study. Hard to sum up the research better than they do. \n\n > When an overturning jet projecting from the crest in a breaking wave rebounds from the free water surface ahead, the strain is locally intensi\ufb01ed between the secondary jet and the primary spanwise vortex behind it. Apparent instability in the saddle region where the maximum stretch occurs almost instantaneously triggers a threedimensional velocity \ufb01eld at the plunging point. Thus, the spanwise undulation of the vorticity, arising from re-orientation of perturbations in the primary vorticity, is \ufb01rst ampli\ufb01ed in the saddle-point \ufb02ow and leads to a wavy vortex loop. At the initial stage of the formation of the vortex loop, the spanwise undulation of vorticity produces a spanwise pressure gradient near the surface and wraps the surface around the vortex axis, to form a \ufb01nger-shaped rebounding jet. A stretch-and-intensi\ufb01cation process in the vortex loop along the principal axis of strain causes normal perturbations to a braid layer, by self-induction between counter-rotating vorticities at the bends of the vortex loop. The continual stretching of the vortex loop in the braid organizes a rib structure, in which the vortex loop envelops the upper part of a new primary vortex produced by the next plunging jet to the bottom of the previous primary vortex behind it.\n\n > Continual deformation of the large-scale vortices and the production of new smallerscale vortices are caused by local strains intensi\ufb01ed among the vortices, even after the breaking front has passed. While some of the vortices dissipate via a cascade (scaling-down) process in the shear \ufb01eld until the next breaking event, the remainder are transported in the reverse \ufb02ow to the next wave breaking point and may trigger further instabilities, leading to a rather complex three-dimensional vortex structure. Thus, especially in the case of a plunging breaker in shallow water, a number of the large-scale vortices are packed within a shallow \ufb02uid region between the descending free surface and the bottom after the wave passes, which causes a more complex evolution of the vortex structure in the locally intensi\ufb01ed strains between the closely packed vortices.\n\n_URL_0_\n\n"

I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox-hunting, bull-fighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley's broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else.\n\nFor fascism itself, especially of the *Partito Nazionale Fascista*, yes, there were some level of quarrel towards what Fascism was supposed to represent. A lot of this comes from the people that were recruited into the movement, and the background that they came from. The economic approach of Fascism as a amalgamation of leftist and rightest policies brought plenty of conflict initially among the *Squadrismo* who had joined up with the intention of literally beating the old order away. You can view the evolving 'goals' of Fascism as Mussolini and the party leaders bargained and schemed in order to improve their power base. For many, fascism was meant to be \"anticapitalist, antimonarchical, anticlerical, antisocialist, antiparliamentary, and, most especially, antibourgeois,\" (Tannenbaum) but this immediately put them at odds with the founders of the Fascist movement, who were almost all former revolutionary socialists and syndicalists. The base of the party in 1919 may have seen the movement as a way to beat people with their *santo manganello,* perform daredevil acts of courage, and overthrow existing order, but by 1921 as chaos and striking had been working its way through Italy alienated students and younger veterans started to join the Fascists as a call *to* order instead of *against* it. \n\nIt's impossible to look at Mussolini for guidance on what the goals of Fascism were, as until he was secure as *il Duce* he considered the PNF as nothing more than an instrument towards his own rise to power, and viewed those underneath him with a mixture of suspicion and contempt. Instead we can turn towards the various leaders of the Fascist movement themselves where we see the quarrel that you asked about. Edmondo Rossoni, president of the National Confederation of Fascist Unions during the 1920's wanted the movement to be a champion of Italian labor against employers. Roberto Farinacci, former party secretary, saw the party as the violent *Squadrismo* and thought Mussolini was too liberal. Giuseppe Bottai saw Fascism as the rise of new cultural elites to lead society, while Alfredo Rocco saw Fascism as a constitutional corporatist state. The only tie that led them to all stick together was the syndicalist nature that they all started in. "

The zeitgeist for the popularity of this particular name, however, is almost certainly the cult of 12th century bishop-martyr-saint Thomas Becket. (Latin *cultus*, devotional practices surrounding a particular saint or Church celebration like prayers of intercession, dedicated sermons and hymns, pilgrimages to a shrine, etc.)\n\nPossibly after St. George (England's patron saint), Becket was *the* saint of late medieval England. The popularity of martyr-saints towards the end of the Middle Ages (in conjunction with a lack of new actual martyrs) only promoted Becket's popularity. Recall that Chaucer's pilgrims are en route to Becket's shrine at Canterbury. He usurped a place for himself alongside Paul as co-patron saints of London. Parish and civic guilds frequently adopted him as their patron saint. While plays revolving around saints' lives and miracles weren't as common in England, there are actually quite a few examples of Becket ones from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. They were popular enough among potential audiences that they're noted to serve as fundraising events for some of those guilds! And Becket's murder certainly brought the entertainment. Surviving records note payment to a local laundry for washing Becket's \"blood\" off the vestments worn by the actor during the martyr scene.\n\nIt's interesting to note that in the sixteenth century, the various efforts at a Protestant Reformation went after the cult of Becket with *extra* zeal--even to the extent of crossing out his name in manuscripts (but [save the artwork!](_URL_0_)), or cutting out just his specific feast day from [liturgical calendars.](_URL_1_) That's more likely a reaction to the actual saint's perceived role as martyr for the Church standing up to the king, than any connection with the multitude of reforming Thomases around Henry.\n\n*Pictures courtesy of the amazing British Library's digitized manuscripts collection.*"

Over sampling refers to any sort of data collection where you need say 100 data points, but instead collect 200 and downscale.\n\nLet's look at a still picture (since this is what I know much better than video). Let's say you want a picture with 1920x1080 pixels. Well you'd probably go grab a camera that captures a picture with 1920x1080 pixels. However no camera is perfect and you'll get little errors often referred to as artifacts. Basically say the pixel should be red and due to a fault, that pixel instead is white.\n\nNow if you took that picture you'd have a tiny little white spot where there should be a red spot. This may not be noticeable but if this happens more often then it will be.\n\nA way to counter this is to over sample. So instead of taking a 1920x1080 picture with a 1920x1080 camera, you use a 3840x2160 camera. So you snap the picture then throw the picture through some sort of processor. The simplified way it down scales (this isn't exactly true as it is MUCH more complicated in reality) is to look at the compared resolutions and average the bigger one down. In the 3840x2160 picture there are 4 pixels to every desired pixel. So the program can take those 4 pixels, average their colours into one and generate the picture.\n\nSo say this spot in the picture was supposed to be red. The 1920x1080 camera gets an error and the pixel is white. The 3840x2160 camera gets 4 pixels, red, red, white, red. Then it averages them down and gets something that's pretty red but slightly lighter.\n\nSimilar principles apply to video except the fancy processing techniques are even fancier.\n\n**TL;DR:** Over sampling lets you smudge out errors in the frame.\n\nEDIT: Updated numbers thanks to /u/Quaytsar"

Boomers and especially the generations older than them have a much lower percentage who have degrees.\n\nAdditionally, you may be using a narrow segment of the population you interact as your frame of reference.

We know that naumachiae were known for rapidly changing land shows and water shows, but no text refers to how it was done. However, the [Flavian Amphitheater was in fact rarely used for naumachiae.](_URL_0_) Most naumachiae were done in natural or artificial basins, which could be flood and drained from the Tiger or sometimes aqueducts (Augustus flooded his from the Aqua Alsietina since it's water was found to be nasty) or in the case of Nero's, in temporary amphitheaters built near the Tiber that could be drained easily. The Flavian Amphitheater was only used for naumachiae a couple of times, and we don't really know how or what it looked like. We assume that the Flavian Amphitheater was flooded with the floor serving as the basin's bottom, but it need not have been so. There's a surviving basin for aquatic shows (probably fish and sea monsters, it's too small for naumachiae) dug into the ground of a smaller amphitheater at Merida--it's below ground level so the idea would have been to put a false floor on top when land shows were staged. Since we have no idea what the Flavian Amphitheater looked like below ground before Domitian added the basements we see now there's no way of knowing--the fact that the naumachiae were only staged early in the amphitheater's life suggests that whatever Domitian did he made it difficult to flood the amphitheater (and certainly no remnants of a drainage system survive)"

The Holocene is only the past ~11,700 years, since the end of the last glaciation.\n\nGenerally for the past ~800,000 years, it has been orbital eccentricity that has dominated the climate signal. This is essentially how oval or circular shaped the Earth's orbit is at any given point. Exactly why eccentricity, which has a very small effect on isolation, appears to control glacial-interglacial cycles has been debated and has been referred to as the ['100,000 year problem'.](_URL_0_)\n\nRegardless, it's widely accepted that climate change occurs due not solely due to orbital forcing (i.e Milankovic cycles) but because of the associated feedbacks as the previous poster said. It's often been pointed out that CO2 lags temperature changes- that's not coincidental, CO2 levels in the atmosphere are largely influenced by ocean productivity. It's been demonstrated that many ocean regions, particularly the Southern Ocean, are dependent on wind blown dust to fertilize. It's been [demonstrated](_URL_1_) when climate is cooler, more dust blows to the ocean (due to less vegetation, drier climate etc) and thus more productivity occurs in the ocean. This helps 'suck up' CO2 from the atmosphere, and helps to keep temperatures low. Then, when eccentricity or another orbital parameter increases temperature a small amount, it can suppress this dust flux and cause a significant drop in CO2 intake by the oceans, causing atmospheric CO2 to rise and a rapid 'runaway' greenhouse effect. \n\nAs mentioned, ice albedo feedback is also important. Permafrost thawing may also release significant amounts of methane into the atmosphere, another potent greenhouse gas. Then there's the further fact that warmer air can hold more moisture, which intensifies the greenhouse effect of water vapour, another GHG.\n\nEssentially the prevailing theory at the moment is that small changes in insolation or perhaps the timing of seasons (e.g shorter/less intense Northern Hemisphere summers favour ice ages) become big changes due to feedbacks associated with the change."
